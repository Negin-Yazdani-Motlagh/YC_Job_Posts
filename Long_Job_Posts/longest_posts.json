        "content": "San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels) * iOS engineerThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/(The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. Remote work is fine. We will handle re-location, including visas, if you would like to re-locate, but re-location is not necessary.If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu"

We're the Robin Hood of business, disrupting the payment space to enable the little guys to do what only the big guys can, and then some. We interact directly with both merchants and their customers, impacting the personal experience on both sides in deep, meaningful ways. We turn rewards and loyalty upside-down (or, as we see it, rightside-up!) by giving points and discounts to customers through their credit card, without the need for special cards, mobile apps, bar codes, or anything else that gets in the way of the experience. We analyze every payment transaction, providing intuitive reports and automated tools for merchants that use them to grow and deeply engage their customers. And that's just the beginning of the possibilities with our passionate team, unique resources, and mission to make our merchants successful!THE OPPORTUNITYCombine a world-class front-end team with a powerfully creative atmosphere, and you get a compelling culture that liberates us all to envision and realize innovative product ideas every day.

You will work with top sales, marketing, and product talent that deeply values innovation and the engineers that drive it.Evolution is our greatest ally. We built the first incarnation of Swipely with jQuery, experimented with Backbone yet quickly realized we needed more structure, and now cruise on YUI3, with YUI3.5 around the corner. We rock MVC-driven, single-page applications, fully templatized Handlebars views, restful JSON persistence to our Rails backends, frontend unit and integration tests, and (soon!) a pushState architecture with hot data visualizations.We always track and contribute to new technologies like D3, Node.js, Ember, Harmony, CoffeeScript, and Less. Exploration and collaboration are part of our culture, and any topic that can improve our engineering efforts is fair game, including NoSQL storage, Nginx/Unicorn architecture, and deployment and continuous integration tools.THE REQUIREMENTSYou love what you do.

We want your help scaling our thousands of events per second and terabytes of data. If you're a fan of distributed systems and like to stress-test a new database every other week, you'll fit right in. And it won't hurt if you like streams, trying out ES6 features, and open-sourcing your work.Our entire backend runs on Node, with a sprinkling of Redis, Mongo, and RabbitMQ. We're open to running a variety of languages and could still use someone to show our Go and Erlang libraries some love.Think that might tickle your fancy? We've got a few projects in the pipeline that you can sink your teeth into right away:Live Debugger You'll build a system that helps developers debug requests to the Segment.io API, and whether the request has been successfully routed to all its destinations. The fun part of this one is working at a variety of scale (isn't it always?). You'll have to build a system which helps devs debug on localhost, but also help them monitor production environments sending 500 requests a second.MapReduce for All We'd love to have a way for developers to query the terabytes of analytics data stored in the Segment.io data warehouse. Can you streamline the process until your mother can submit mapreduce queries with ease?Data Export APIs Perhaps you'd like to build an API to export analytics data from Amazon S3 (or maybe even Glacier?). Exporting will have to stream terabytes of data without waking our ops guys in the middle of the night.

The market is flooded with new mobile analytics startups, but underneath they all collect the same data. And anytime you make an analytics change, you have to re-submit your app to the app store. Bummer. :'(Developers can drop in our SDK and then later enable any of Segment.io\u2019s dozens of analytics integrations without writing additional code or even submitting updates to the app store. Both iOS and Android SDKs are open source, so you'll be working closely with the rest of the community (and get a great chance to show off your work).Here's some examples of what you'd probably tackle at Segment.io:Best New Tools As the maintainer of the SDKs, you'd have total control over which analytics tools get added and distributed across millions of devices. What are the best new tools? Something for an interesting new app category? Help our users find the best-in-breed mobile analytics tools, and build them into the SDKs so that they can enable them instantly.Community Distribution As Segment.io's mobile expert, you'll be guiding (and helping write!) lots of the mobile content marketing we produce. We want you to become the world's leading expert on mobile analytics, knowing the business models, industry, tools and problems inside and out.

Which parts of the product need the most love?\" You'll be in charge of automating as much of that as possible without sacrificing quality.Currently we get about 40 support requests per day. Here's the breakdown:35% are variations of \"thanks your product is super awesome!\" which are fun. 25% are technical support requests for our main javascript library. You might have to jump on Skype with a Ukrainian developer or a Japanese designer (watch the timezone!) or maybe run down the street to help a local startup. 15% are technical problems with our mobile libraries for iOS and Android. 10% require debugging a server-side integration: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, or Node. 5% are completely confused, but we still <3 them. and the remaining 10% are hiring, sales and other random inquiries. This kind of analysis should feel natural to you!Your analysis of support issues, feature requests, and customer feedback will be absolutely critical to planning tasks with the rest of the team. We want to make sure we're all building things that will benefit our customers.Segment.io's support team also educates our customers on how the product works.

        "content": "We Are Pop Up - London, UK - Web Application Developer (full-time)We Are Pop Up is a community-driven marketplace for short-term commercial property leasing. While we certainly didn't invent the concept of a \"pop up shop\", we're embracing it whole-heartedly as a solution to two social problems which have arisen in our time: 1) How can we lower the barrier-to-entry to enable a new generation of retail, food, and creative entrepreneurs to operate as easily in the offline world as businesses currently do online? 2) As commerce increasingly moves online, vacant property is left behind, which can have detrimental effects on both the nearby businesses and the greater community alike. How can we find new ways of filling that space? The missing piece which transforms these two real problems into mutual solutions is an excellent software platform that removes the time and overhead typically associated with commercial leasing. We Are Pop Up officially launched this platform near the end of 2012, and has already given numerous creative entrepreneurs around the UK opportunities to engage the offline world in ways they never had before.We're looking for an experienced Web Application Developer to work directly along side our Lead Developer and Creative Director, building features and scaling the platform. Someone who's comfortable working with the whole stack, understands the principles of excellent software development, and wants to treat their code as their craft. We're primarily in a Django/Python environment, but any relevant experience is great, as long as you are willing to learn Python. The number of years you've been working professionally isn't too important (though it should be at least \"a few\"), but what you've done is. Being an expert in SQL will get you a lot of points. We follow Agile development practices, and you'll be shipping features frequently.--Skills and Attributes We're Looking For (being 100% in all is not required, but candidates who are will receive preference)* Experience building web applications from the bottom, up. Django/Python experience preferred, but Rails/Ruby, PHP, etc. is also great, so long as you're a quick and willing learner* Solid knowledge of SQL and related best practices. We use Postgres, but are happy with MySQL or similar experience* Ability to work in Javascript/HTML/CSS. We use YUI 3 and Bootstrap. You certainly don't need to be a designer, but you should be able to take on a feature and fully implement it, including all relevant front-end code* General understanding of Solr/Lucene search* Experience deploying basic server infrastructure and with the Unix command line (being an expert SysAdmin is not required)* Familiarity with code profiling and optimization* Interested in things like Agile development, TDD, and pair-programming* Work equally well in close coordination with others and independently/self-directed. We're a small team, so we'll always be working closely, sometimes in pairs, but often you'll need to be able to take on things on your own* Legally eligible to work in the UK (mandatory)What We're Offering* Competitive salary, based on experience* Meaningful, early-employee equity* Regularly attend some of the coolest pop-up events and parties in London* Work on a developer-driven software team, where your contributions will have a hugely positive impact on the lives of othersMore About UsWe're a group of Brits and Americans who came together in the spring of 2012 to take on an ambitious idea cooked up by 2 of our co-founders in a pub one evening (where all good ideas start). We're artists and environmentalists, consultants and entrepreneurs, engineers and educators. Collectively we've worked with Fortune 500s, government and the public sector, universities, creatives, small businesses, and (other) start-ups. We're alumni of Springboard Mobile in the fall of 2012 and we're looking to change the world.Principals only, no recruitersPlease submit your CV, a paragraph summarizing your relevant experience, and links to your work on Github, Bitbucket, etc. to jobs[at]wearepopup.com, with the subject \"Hacker News candidate for your Web Application Developer role\"We look forward to hearing from you!"

Improving the coach reporting tools and adding more gamification. Polishing up an in-progress Android wrapper for KA Lite, so it can be used completely standalone on mobile devices. Adding support for internationalized interfaces and content (dubbed videos and translated exercises). Adding the features that you, the interns, dream up! Bring your ideas to help increase educational access, and improve the user experience for both students and teachers.We will also be beginning development on a new platform for distributing and hosting other open-licensed educational materials (beyond Khan Academy), as well as allowing teachers to author their own content -- offline -- to use in their classrooms as well as share back with the rest of the world.

If you want, you can work 20 hours per week, or you can work 40 (although we do ask for at least 20). - Set realistic goals for yourself and hold yourself accountable for reaching them. - Familiarity with some programming language and the ability and willingness to spend time on your own learning the technologies that we use (Python, Django, JavaScript, etc). - A commitment to providing access to education and promoting open content.What life will be like: FLE is a pretty diverse group. Members enjoy playing soccer, board games, making marmalade, visiting Mexico (a 30-minute drive), doing Arduino projects, going to local San Diego Meetups, making sandcastles, bodyboarding, eating vegan food, playing various awesome instruments and learning to play new ones.

You could call this an intern type position, but I don't care if you are in school or not.Prgmr.com rents virtual private servers, dedicated servers, and datacenter space. Right now, we have 3 full-time folks, counting me, and two part-timers but I'm the only hardware person, and only two of us are local.So, there are several catches. the first? I can't afford a full time person for at least two months. If you are willing to show up and work between then and now? $15/hr on a 1099. After those two months (and after I'm done paying for twice the co-lo I need) we can talk about going full time W2. (prgmr.com pays for Kaiser, if you are full-time)Now, I do have an arrangement with a local refurbished server and network hardware dealer; I give him a good entry level person, he'll hire them full time with health insurance and stuff (for a little more than I'm paying; not a lot more, this is definitely still entry-level pay.) and he'll rent you back to me on a per-day basis at a discount (sort of as a referral bonus to me.) - so that's one way you can make this full-time before I stabilize prgmr.com. Note, he's based out of mountain view, and I'm in Santa Clara and all of this is very much hands-on work.So yeah, what I need is someone I can teach how to handle my layer-1. I need my shit wired up, I need it wired up neatly (I can train you in cable lacing, but the neater you are, the better.) I need all my ports labeled inside my network gear (I can show you how to do this; Serial ain't rocket science.) and inside my PDUs.This would be pretty good for someone studying up on their CCNA or something; I probably have obsolete hardware I could give you for your lab, too.I need someone I can train up to set up my IPMI out of band access. Again, I can train, it's not hard. Again, experience using the command line helps a lot.I also need someone who can handle racking/stacking servers, dragging servers to the car and back. You need to be able to safely lift 50lbs, (and more importantly, you need to ask for help when you /can't/ lift safely. pester the security guys; they will usually help, and if not, call me.) and you need transportation that can handle 50lb servers. (meh, if you have transportation, we can probably work something out with the hauling. I've got an old van I loan people.)You need to be able to handle ssh, and ssh with public key authentication with minimal help from me.So, the way I usually do this is that people email me, we go back and forth a few times (I won't hire you if you can't communicate via email... sorry, just one of my things.) then next time I need help I call you up. You show up and work. I pay you (check, but if you want we can drop by the bank and get it cashed for you same day... just when I pay cash the accountant gets mad at me) If you do well and I need help again, i call you back; At these rates, (and especially with this (lack of) stability) it's not fair to expect you to interview for free.So yeah. Entry level. If you seem teachable, I don't care if you are currently unemployed.I demand honesty, but not loyalty; by that, I mean I'm realistic. I'm not going to be angry if you move on to a better paying job quickly.Especially at first, while we're just doing 'as needed' gigs? I'm understanding about your schedule; I don't demand you drop everything for me. (Once you go full time, we'll have to talk more about this. I do eventually want someone besides me to be hardware on-call, but I understand that needs to be worth your time, and this offer probably is probably not good enough to get you to let me drag your ass out of bed at 2am.) loungin on May 1, 2013 | parent | next [\u2013] It is refreshing to see posts like this that are willing to teach.

That, and ISPs/hosting companies have traditionally been good places for entry-level folk. There is a strong culture or tradition of mentorship, or at least, of hiring likely looking folk and letting them run systems above their pay grade. (and to be clear, this will be a lot of that, too; I mean, I don't expect you to know this stuff off the bat, and I expect some questions, but I also expect a certain level of ability to, you know, look it up and figure it out.)Locally?

To reduce downtime, companies depend on a global supply chain of warehouses, delivery services, and manufacturers to supply the service parts to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world. Baxter Planning Systems is seeking outstanding Java Developers to optimize and automate every facet of this service parts supply chain.Baxter Planning Systems offers a unique environment combining the flexibility of a startup with the stability of an established company. Our developers are involved in the entire product lifecycle, from problem description to design and execution. 20 years of established business with numerous satisfied customers provides ongoing revenue that isolates us from the anxiety of funding cycles or the constant search for the next big deal.Working closely with on-staff domain experts, our developers have the opportunity to learn about the complexities of global supply chain management, and offer their own solutions to the challenges it presents. Challenges like planning optimal stocking levels for tens of thousands of parts distributed across thousands of locations worldwide, combined with complex interdependencies due to substitutability, regulatory issues, and the need to minimize both downtime and cost.The ideal candidate for Baxter is a smart developer who gets things done by applying technology, especially open source, to meet our goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The development and QA teams work closely with key stakeholders to formulate and manage development timelines that are both realistic and produce high-quality application features. You won't have to start from scratch either: we have a great infrastructure of automated unit/integration/regression/UI tests, automated builds, virtualized test environments, and a solid technology stack. But we recognize there's always room for improvement and welcome the experience and expertise you'd bring in improving our development practices, tools, and execution.Regretfully at this time we are unable to accommodate 3rd party placement agencies, H-1B sponsorships, long-term telecommuting, or relocation.

In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has.

It doesn't make much sense to me why a developer in a low cost of living area is worth less in terms of what features they develop for the company. I say this as someone who lives in a high cost of living area, so I'd be at the higher end of your scale and this is not a self serving comment. icodestuff on May 2, 2013 | root | parent | next [\u2013] If the best developer for the job happens to be in Manhattan or SF, s/he won't take a job paying Detroit or Wichita salaries. epicureanideal on May 2, 2013 | root | parent | next [\u2013] Right, but if they don't produce more than the \"normal Wichita salary\" then you probably shouldn't hire them. If they produce enough value to be worth $150,000 per year let's say, then you pay them that. If they don't, you shouldn't pay them that much whether they live in SF or Detroit.If they do produce enough to be worth $150,000, why pay them less just because they live in Wichita? Supply and demand, sure, but it just seems odd to me to explicitly say that you're paying less if someone lives outside of a major metropolitan area. I prefer to be (or think that I am) paid based on the value I produce (value pricing) rather than what it costs to keep a roof over my head (cost pricing). Whether or not this is the case also influences my understanding of how a company thinks about me. kroy on May 2, 2013 | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013] A lower salary for a developer in low CoL area doesn't indicate that a company values that resource less than another dev in a higher CoL area. It just means that the company has to pay less in order to reward the developer in the low CoL as much as the employer rewards the high CoL dev. The equation looks like this:salary - CoL/year = reward_dev epicureanideal on May 2, 2013 | root | parent | next [\u2013] Sure, but I still find it interesting to make the following observation:The CoL modification to the developer's salary has nothing to do with whether the company makes more or less revenue as a result of their work.My guess is that as companies find good talent increasingly hard to find this problem will resolve itself as the remote workers outside major metropolitan areas get bidded to higher and higher salaries.

We\u2019re in search of back-end developers with a passion for solving hard problems with performant code. If you are interested in creating great products, building new features and improving the existing Shopify features, then please apply!Developing ShopifyShopify is the longest continuously developed Rails app on the planet and we care a great deal about code quality. Shopify, in contrast to most other rails shops, always runs on the latest rails version. Many core rails features have been developed within Shopify and have later been added to the Rails framework. We often go back and improve core parts of the Shopify codebase to make it better or more lean. We can do this because we have a positively massive unit test coverage which will immediately sound the alarm when something goes wrong.We ship on quality instead of on time. When a feature is ready we deploy it immediately to everyone or use an internal system to roll it out to a certain percentage of customers. Various teams deploy new code many times throughout the day.Shopify's production scale is massive. We host tens of thousands of online stores and regularly see hundreds of millions of requests a day. When you push out new code tons of people will see what you made within seconds. Operating on this level is hard but incredibly rewarding.Responsibilities:* Write back-end code in Ruby and Go.* Work with a world class design and product team.* Providing beautiful and fast code that improves the code-base of our products in meaningful ways.* Use TDD to write rock-solid code, utilizing our huge test suite to make changes with confidence.* Rapidly fix bugs or take your time to solve hard problems well.* Deploy code to hundreds of servers and tens of thousands of customers in your first week.* Never stop learning. Shopify is an environment of constant personal growth.Qualifications and Desired Skills:* Know Rails or be ready to learn it quickly.* Proficiency with UNIX commands.* Knowledge of relational databases and SQL, we use MySQL.* Strong commitment to quality.* Experience building and scaling user-focused web application.* Being awesome and having a love for Shopify - Major Plus! psycr on May 1, 2013 | parent | next [\u2013] What does Shopify use Go for?

We've hit a point in our growth where it makes sense to start thinking about fast services rather than throwing more job servers at the problem, so a few things are being extracted to new Go services here and there. We intend to continue along this line, using Go where we'd like more performance (concurrency) than we can trivially get out of ruby, or if it feels like it fits the problem domain. tdz on May 1, 2013 | parent | prev | next [\u2013] Hey!

Interested in being part of a friendly, dynamic team in a central Cambridge studio? We want to talk to front or back end developers who are creative, organised and love all things web. Ideally you'll have some or all of the following skills:Knowledge of writing standards-compliant, high-performing HTML5 and CSS web pages. Experience of working with popular web libraries. We use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job. Good knowledge of at least one programming language. We work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too. An understanding of database programming and design. Familiarity with *nix based operating systems. Awareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook. More important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).What you can expect to work onExpect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.How we workAs a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.LearningThe web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.LifestyleWorking at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles. Just ten minutes walk from the station and ten minutes walk from the centre of Cambridge, the office is located just of Mill Road, the cultural heart of Cambridge (and probably the closest thing you can get to a London street outside of the capital). We're surrounded by green spaces, pubs, shops and caf\u00e9s (including the legendary Hot Numbers). We've even got parking spaces. We operate a flexitime scheme too so those of you who are commuting from out of town don't have to spend four hours a day stuck in a traffic jam to and from work.How to applyPlease send CV, covering note and links to any websites or applications you have created, or been involved with, to jobs@onespacemedia.com.

As such we have need for:- backend engineers[1]- product engineers[2]We're analytical about the work that we do and you should be too. You should also care about getting things done right, and be pragmatic about when to choose speed over quality, if you opt for the former you're the type of engineer that makes a note that you shorted on quality and you'll come back and fix that up.We keep small engineering teams (usually no more than 10 people per team), this permits us to own what we work on. It is one of the best things about working here in my experience!The low down on the positions:[1] - Backend EngineersWith 30m MAU (last published number... it is bigger now!) our backend engineers work to keep our service humming along with five nines of uptime. Your work would include not only improving core pieces of infrastructure but also envisaging new pieces that we do not have yet that will help take us to the next level. Some examples of things that have been done recently:- migration to ruby 1.9- built out a new IRC chat server which handles ~1000 qps. Best thing here is we slotted this in and no one noticed (except that chat was more stable, etc).- Created a brand new API to access our data, this is used by Activision (Call of Duty: Black Ops II), EA (EA origin) and PlanetSide II, Smite, amongst a wide array of other game devs.- Replaced a core piece of infrastructure used to let us know what streams are live, and what content they have on them. Again, this has been done without anyone noticing - its main win was taking us from needing 8 app servers to being able to handle all the load on one, but we run a couple of resilience.. naturallyWe've a bunch of other coolness in the pipeline.[2] - Product EngineersOne of the reasons we're growing so fast is that we're starting to churn out high quality features and general product improvements. There is still so far to go, the twitch you see now is as a result of dedicating much of our engineering work to scaling, in that time we've hired some kick ass product engineers and they're starting to push us forwards.

Currently we have a few PhD's, few ex-googler's, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( http://www.testng.org ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( http://mailinator.blogspot.com ). And we're only up to 7 people. But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.Job Description: Someone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.Our technology includes: Java. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)Job Requirements: You know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold. You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there. You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.The interview:We love solving problems and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code. So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun. Right answers aren't the point - finding a good attack vector on the problem is.Our CTO's take on getting your resume Silicon Valley ready: http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-get-your-resume-... theflyingkiwi42 on May 1, 2013 | prev | next [\u2013] Simply Studio / 17 Hats (http://simplystudio.com/) - IRVINE, CA / REMOTE (US/CANADA preferred)We're looking for a senior web developer to join our team.

The plan is to deploy a basic version this week sometime, gather feedback over a few days and then fine-tune it based on what the customers say.Just after lunch, while you code, you come across a bug in the queuing sub-system. You decide that it would be simple for you to fix it as well and so you do. While you fixed the bug, you thought about how you can make the queuing system much more scalable. You write a quick note to yourself to talk about it later.By the end of the day you'll have a good chunk of the new feature implemented. You'll send that queuing system bug fix for code-review tomorrow morning and continue your work of the new feature.

Work permit and relocation assistance provided.Hiring for two different companies, both of whom will pay your relocation.Company 1:Looking for UX designers, front-end and back-end developers. UX designer: use Photoshop, Gimp, or whatever makes your socks roll up and down and you know how to make Web and/or mobile applications work for customers. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS also needed.Front-end developer: you can make Web sites do exactly what you want them to do, regardless of the browser or operating system the web site is running on. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required.Back-end developers: you know what it takes to power the back-end of large web sites. You understand scalability issues and can explain the difference between an inner and outer join. You know what O(log N) is and why it's important. Your programming language history isn't important because you're good enough to learn a new language if needed.All positions: not looking for rock stars. Looking for competent technical talent who are willing to move to Europe (unless you're already here). We have many expats working here and we'll even help pay for Dutch lessons, if you want them.We also like people who understand business because you'll be expected to make many of your own decisions without having to ask permission from management for every little thing that you do. You will have the power to get stuff done, work with a great bunch of people and be able to spend your five weeks of vacation time cruising across Europe and discovering why Amsterdam is such a beautiful city.Company 2:Unlike Company 1, Company 2 is looking for rock stars to bring to Amsterdam. They want front-end devs and system engineers. They want you to have at least a bachelor's degree in IT or a related field and you have to have a fairly impressive resume/CV (in terms of work, open source or educational background (preferably all three)) to even get an interview. In return, they offer a very agile environment, hard tasks, in a stable, long-term company. Large company, but each team gets a room with only a few people (no open-plan distractions). Management gets out of your way and meetings are discouraged. There's a heavy focus on constant performance optimization of systems because no one like a slow system. Multiple programming languages are used with the language being chosen to fit the problem and not the other way around.Front-end devs: mostly PHP with Smarty and Propel, though other languages, such as Java, and Python are used. You will be working on desktop, tablet and mobile applications and know Javascript and CSS fluently. This means more than just jQuery! Mobile experience is helpful, as it UX work.System Engineers: you will be responsible for thousands of Linux servers across several data centers. Company 2 serves a quarter of a billion page views a day and heavy use of the latest open-source technologies is encouraged in their quest for better and better performance. Nginx, Puppet, stackless Python and MySQL are just a few of the technologies involved. The engineers are heavily involved in open source and are encouraged to give back to the community. You have deep experience in Linux, preferably multiple distributions, you know bash and at least one scripting language. You have strong experience with a variety of open source monitoring and scalability technologies.To apply for any of these, send an email to jobs at allaroundtheworld.fr and refer to this post. zukhan on May 1, 2013 | parent | next [\u2013] Just a tip, you'd probably get more traction if you mentioned names of the companies and what they actually do. Ovid on May 2, 2013 | root | parent | next [\u2013] You're right, but there's a catch-22: my wife and I are starting a company focusing on helping people move to other countries. For recruiting, we currently only work with companies who sponsor work permits and help with relocation. Thus, I act as a recruiter for those companies and if I mention their names or get too specific about what they do, candidates can apply directly. That not only removes any commission we make referring them, it also kills any chance we have to help the candidate prepare for the interviews.I am very passionate about helping people become expats (my wife and I have both lived in multiple countries) and I'm just hoping I can find a way to turn my passion into a business. apaprocki on May 1, 2013 | prev | next [\u2013] New York / London - Bloomberghttp://jobs.bloomberg.com/ http://www.bloomberg.com/uxThere are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I'm particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R&D. We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level \"app\" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion \"ticks\" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one \"feed\") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)We could use a motto like \"We do a lot of stuff.\"Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. and we'll have a few people at JSConf in May.

A world where access to comprehensive step-by-step instructions in multiple languages enables billions of people to improve their lives, in both ordinary and extraordinary ways. That\u2019s the world we want to create.==Where== wikiHow is located in a homey office in downtown Palo Alto, California, three blocks from the Palo Alto Caltrain Station. We also have satellite offices in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington.==Why we\u2019re different== * We take wikiHow's educational mission seriously. We put our mission above short-term business goals. * We pay well. You get the joys of a nonprofit mission with a competitive for-profit salary and benefits package. * We have a huge number of users, but a very small team. Your work will make an immediate, noticeable impact on millions of people. * We all work from home one day a week. * We don't think working long startup hours is productive or healthy. We work hard and productively, then go enjoy rich lives outside of work. * Our small, cohesive team is gender balanced: 50% female, 50% male. * We\u2019re often wrong (and that\u2019s OK). Making mistakes shows that we are innovating. We love to innovate. * We like walking. We even have a few treadmill desks. * We love coming to work every day. Working with intelligent people to accomplish something globally ambitious is intrinsically satisfying. * We like to share. We develop open source software and Creative Commons licensed content. * With over 40 million readers a month, wikiHow is one of the top 200 sites on the web. Even your mom will use and love our product. * We are profitable and growing. * We are self-funded. We refuse VC money on a regular basis. Investors don\u2019t make our decisions, we do. * We are better in person than on TV: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI * We're delightfully quirky (but you probably figured that out already).=== A warning === Before you book an appointment with us, you should understand that wikiHow is not hoping to be acquired or looking for a quick financial exit. Our company is already profitable, financially stable (aka your job isn\u2019t going away at someone\u2019s whim), and we all love working here, so we aren\u2019t in a rush to sell it to some big company. In fact, we think we are doing a pretty good job running it, and selling it might mean the end to a product that we all love working on. The team here shares a passion for helping the millions of people we reach everyday. It is an amazing feeling to work on such a popular and impactful product! That amazing feeling makes us smile when we wake up every day and think about going to work. If all of this sounds appealing to you, we encourage you to apply...

That\u2019s more than 8 million users per engineer! Everything you build will make an immediate impact on millions of people.Some of the problems wikiHow engineers are working on: * Building user-facing features for our volunteer editing community that are fun enough to gather mass usage, while simultaneously making sure the output of the work produces high-quality educational information. It\u2019s easy to get people to upload funny cat memes on the Web; the real challenge comes when you want them to create and curate the world\u2019s best instructional content. * Creating features to bring in new content contributors. To keep growing and achieve our goals, we solve how to enable contributors from mobile devices, as well as continuing to gain new desktop community members. * Scaling, scaling, scaling. We get more users before 10 AM than most startups will get in their entire existence. * Big data. Lots of usage creates lots of data that we work with to further improve our products. * Mobile and tablets. The majority of wikiHow users will soon be on portable devices, but they don\u2019t practice typical behavior patterns. We are rethinking wikis and collaboratively created content for the mobile era. * Reader delight features. Better software means happier readers. We\u2019re inventing new ways to make learning pleasant and more efficient. * Your awesome idea!

Our engineering team has a flat structure - one of our explicit goals is to create a space where we are all on equal footing to create opportunities to teach ourselves and learn from each other. We encourage everyone to be constantly questioning and evaluating our development processes so that we can keep getting better over time. Every engineer has a tremendous amount of power in terms of identifying what the most impactful things to be working on are, and to take on those challenges with the support of the team.Q: Are you a pretty casual startup or more corporate styled? A: We have a couple key meetings each week. Each morning we have a standup that we expect the whole team to be present for; having the team start the day together is important to us. We finish each week with a retrospective where we gather around a whiteboard, have some drinks, and consider the process for the week. Taking time each week to reflect on what went well and how we can replicate success, as well as what didn't and how we can avoid similar mistakes in the future makes this feel like one of the healthiest teams I have ever been a part of.Q: Do you guys pair program? A: We definitely encourage pairing - I probably spend about a quarter of my time coding with a partner, and I'm trying to find ways to do even more. We used to have pairing stations set up explicitly for this (two keyboards, two mice, four monitors), but as our team has gotten more comfortable with other solutions like screen sharing via tmux the pairing stations have gently fallen into disuse. I would love to hear what setups you have found to be successful in encouraging good pairing sessions. We're always looking to find more ways to effectively collaborate!Q: What is the developer life like? A: In my opinion, the developer life at Causes is pretty spectacular. I get to work with some of the most awesome people I know, both technically and in a wide variety of other talents and interests. Jimmy, who leads our engineering team, used to be a performing stage magician. Rocky works with our Impact team and has represented the US in Ultimate Frisbee tournaments. There is a level of passion in my coworkers that I've never seen anywhere else, and I get to spend my time working, eating, talking, and playing with these people. As a developer, I get to work with fantastic technology. We are constantly upgrading our stack, and I often get to learn about things that are new to me. Most of our devs spend the day ssh'd into a workstation editing code in Vim, although we have one dev who tunnels the filesystem so that he can work in RubyMine, and at different times we have had folks working in TextMate, Sublime, Emacs, and Eclipse. All of our code goes through a code review tool called Gerrit that we use both to prevent software defects and as a way to teach each other about our craft. Gerrit is integrated with our Jenkins CI so that every patch has the complete test suite run against it before being merged.We work in small development teams that generally include four developers, a product manager, and a designer. These teams give engineering access to the product design process that I haven't seen at the other companies I have been at. There's a neat sense of satisfaction when you are pairing with a designer to tweak a page into perfection. Working directly with the product team means that we get a lot of insight into what is coming down the pipe, and can often contribute to the direction of the product.------------Have you seen enough and you're now interested in joining the team?

Full time.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/ (The Future of Peer Review) and here http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/ (The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers.

Sorry, we're not set up to sponsor overseas applicants at this time.The things we care about (in rough order)- Good cultural fit. It's a small team so we'll be seeing a lot of each other, and we want that to be something we're all happy about- A team player who can work with minimal supervision. We're busy and everyone's got a lot on their plate, so we want to be able to help each other out, but we also need everyone to be able to pick up their own work and run with it.- Happy to work full stack & full life-cycle. One day might be spent brainstorming how we want some end-user features to work, and the next day spent neck deep in code. If you like that sort of variety, that's a good thing.- Happy to work with our technology stack, and able to productive quickly. I don't care too much whether you have GWT or AWS experience, as long as you're happy to work with it, and happy to put the effort in to get up to speed fast. Obviously if having experience makes those things easier.In return we can offer- Flexible work arrangements. Both of us (the 2 full-timers) have young kids, so if you're in a similar situation we're happy to talk about how we can accommodate.- A chance to do Java development in Sydney without working for a bank/telco/consultancy. Those who work in Sydney will know that there's only a handful of interesting companies, and the rest is big corporate dev work (I know, I've done lots of it). If you've got a Java skillset but want to break out of that world, then here's an opportunity.- A fun office environment.

There are more than 5,000 rare genetic diseases, in total affecting millions of Americans, and our serious goal is to find treatments for 100 rare diseases in the next 10 years.Our approach is to model rare genetic diseases in human cells, then use these disease models to find drugs that revert the cells to a healthy state, and thus are strong candidates for impacting the disease in patients. In a pretty quick experiment, we image millions of human cells. Image segmentation and analysis quickly makes thousands of measurements, resulting in a very deep quantitation of the state of every single cell. The challenge at hand is running the right experiments in the right way and analyzing results to make the discoveries we seek.I previously co-founded BuildASign.com, a bootstrapped custom printing ecommerce business set to do over $70M in 2014 revenues, and I left daily operations several years back to study biology, bioinformatics, machine learning and drug discovery. My co-founder, Chris, and I started Recursion to turn drug discovery into a computational problem.

This includes researching, suggesting and testing different statistical and machine learning approaches, along with changing our experimental setup to provide more useful information with every round of experiments. You\u2019ll set the groundwork for how we\u2019ll design and analyze thousands of experiments in the coming years.>> Software Engineer (Python):- You have several years of experience in python software development, preferably using ipython and other scientific python tools. You\u2019re also super-comfortable at the command line and handling the standard a linux server, and great at solving any kind of computational issue via stackoverflow. No sysadmins, DBAs or the like will be around to help for a while.- You\u2019re motivated by challenging problems, and by the idea of making millions of patients\u2019 lives dramatically better, as fast as we can.- You\u2019ll work with biologists and data scientists to develop tools to manage and automate our experiments and analyses. To manage the experiments and analyses it will take to treat 100 diseases in 10 years, we\u2019ll need a pretty amazing set of systems in place eventually, but need to get there incrementally so that we can make rapid progress immediately using the resources we have.>> About Recursion:We work in a beautiful office and lab space set directly at the base of the mountains, overlooking Salt Lake City, situated directly one floor above the drug discovery core at the University of Utah, giving us direct access to millions of dollars of cutting edge lab automation and imaging equipment.

We work with direct access to our clients and business data, and we communicate openly and transparently with the executive team.We're working from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely and we rely on collaborative communication and dev tools like GitHub, HipChat, Google Hangouts and Heroku to get it all done.The Role: We're looking for a Sr. Full Stack Engineer to join our team.

You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation. * Product-Centric Thinking: You come from a tech background but you have opinions about how the product you're building should work.

        "content": "Senior PHP Engineer We Are Base Bournemouth, United Kingdom Full time, in houseA bit about the roleThis is a genuine opportunity to work alongside talented people to innovate and build digital services that make a difference to people every day, including an exciting product spin out. Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:1st class engineerYou will be used to working as part of an unsilo\u2019d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they\u2019re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript/Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You\u2019ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura & Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You\u2019ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs & databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You\u2019ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionalityData hungryYou\u2019ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You\u2019ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You\u2019ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you\u2019ve helped architect.Open all hoursYou\u2019ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you\u2019ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you\u2019ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.Solver of riddlesYou won\u2019t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you\u2019ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn\u2019t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.Getting shit doneYou\u2019ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren\u2019t perfect, but you\u2019ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You\u2019ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.Commercially awareYou will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You\u2019ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn\u2019t fall over as its user base scales. You\u2019ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.Keen eye, tuned earAn eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We\u2019ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You\u2019ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You\u2019ll know that most project budgets don\u2019t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you\u2019re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.Security and speedYou\u2019ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You\u2019ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we\u2019re after. But then you already know that.About We Are BaseWe're a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable. Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We\u2019re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are rare by design.http://wearebase.com/hiring"

We're a small, 50-person non-profit tech startup making a big difference in the world. Here's a testimonial we received just last night:December 31, 2013I have recently turned thirteen, and accompanied by your proficient and efficient teaching style, I have successfully advanced into multi-variable calculus. When I was 9 I began Calculus. However when I started these courses, I was capable of grasping these concepts in a deep level of intuition. Now I am advancing into Green's Theorem, Triple Integrals, Divergence, Curl, Gradient, and Partial Derivatives. In essence, I would just like to say thank you for providing this revolutionary interconnected education interface. Hopefully I will be taking the AP Calculus examinations soon!Thank you for everything!How cool is that? Think of how many similar students are born to learn advanced math and science but never get the chance. We're working to change this. This letter is one story; every month we hear about hundreds more lives like this that we've totally transformed.We're starting to do a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs right now. We're totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now you can build large parts of a product that's guaranteed to have millions of users. If you are (or you know) a mobile developer we can build a great team around,please reach out. You can't find this sort of opportunity in very many places.Lots of people know us for Sal's videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of interactive exercises. Our 100,000+ math problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That's a huge number.With this scale, we're able to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We've run tests which show that students learn more when they're advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how Socratic-style lectures affect engagement. (We're also beginning to release anonymized data to interested researchers.)Whether you're a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You'll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business \u2013 though we have \"celebrity\" devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google's first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven't heard of but who are just as awesome.We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we're a non-profit, we pay well too.---As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us and we're doing everything we can to find great mobile devs.We're hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we're hiring interns too.Please apply athttps://www.khanacademy.org/careersdirectly (say you saw us on HN!), but if you have questions, feel free to ask here or to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org.Thanks for reading; have a great 2014![1]:http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...[2]:http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...[3]:http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/(sorry about the background, but there are dinosaur pictures!)[4]:http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we...[5]:http://life.khanacademy.org/"

We believe that what we're working on is the biggest financial and social impact opportunity in the world today. Enlitic uses recent advances in machine learning to make medical diagnostics faster, more accurate, and more accessible. Founded by Kaggle's past president and chief scientist, its mission is to provide the tools that allow physicians to fully utilize the vast stores of medical data collected today, regardless of what form they are in - such as medical images, doctors' notes, and structured lab tests. To realize this vision, we are building on state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and partnering with top research hospitals and medical device manufacturers. We've raised $15m funding and have a small team of 16 applied machine learning researchers and commercialization experts.If you're interested in playing with cool hardware and data, we're a great place to come. We use a cluster of hundreds of Tesla K80 GPUs, and have many millions of medical images - some single images are over 10GB in size. Many are 3d, which makes for some really interesting engineering challenges. We use a wide range of tools and languages, including Python (Theano, Pandas/Numpy/etc, Flask), Meteor, CoffeeScript, React and C++ (Caffe). We have regular journal club talks (mainly recent deep learning papers), and a good mix of research and applied work. Our day to day work covers a lot of cancer detection and treatment planning, as well as a wide range of other high impact medical issues - the consistent underlying theme is using a data-driven approach to improving patient outcomes. There are particularly big opportunities (both financial and social impact) in the developing world. We're working with many of the top academics in the medical diagnostics field, and are partnering with some of the top hospitals around the country and around the world. We are looking for people that have an in depth understanding of linear algebra, convex optimization, algorithm design, and software engineering, to join us as data scientists, full stack and frontend engineers, and dev ops engineers.

We're slowly hiring mid-level and senior full stack developers (one every couple of months), but our next hire or two will be focused on app dev! We have patient and clinician apps that need to be re-worked and greatly expanded (to navigate a diverse medical record), and we've been working for a while now on a maternity app that takes the midwives and mother all the way through a pregnancy. That app is based on AppGyver Steroids (which in turn is built around Cordova), so you should be able to jump into that fairly easily. We're thus working with JavaScript, WebSQL, jQuery, backbone, HTML/CSS. Extra points if you've dealt with large/complex apps and managing data offline (and the complexity that comes with synching periodically with the server, where new data may come from either the app or the server);For the server side -- apps authenticate with OAuth2, speaking JSON to a REST API; our server-side back end and webapp are primarily Java-based, gradually being refactoring towards a microservice structure. So if you're interested in helping out as well implementing new REST calls as needed, Java experience will ease that path.More about PKBI've worked in a lot of different sectors since I first started writing code in the late 90s, including education, b2b supply chains, POS systems, e-commerce, banking, and anti-spam.PKB has been head-and-shoulders above the rest in everything I care about.We're building something that actively, directly, improves the lives of people in general -- not selling more stuff, helping others sell more stuff, or making comfortable people a bit more comfortable. If you're interested in PKB's growth, funding, profitability, contracts, etc., ask -- our CEO is also active on HN. I'm in the CTO role.We're pragmatic about work/life balance. I work from France, or sometimes from Malaysia, where my in-laws live. Almost half of the developers have small children at home -- personally, I get my kids up in the morning, and I'm with them entirely late-afternoon & evening (while my wife works), then I fill in some extra hours around the edges as needed. We're collaboratively figuring out what works (e.g., how many working hours should you overlap to collaborate effectively?), and planning our lives and our work around what's effective, not around some photocopied list of rules stapled to a cubicle wall. One of our developers only codes part time (and occasionally takes long leaves of absence), because he's also a theatre director.Culture -- we live in various parts of the UK, central France, Bangalore, Vienna, Budapest, NYC and Costa Rica; we range in age (though I don't actually know everyone's ages, so I can't say exactly!). We're not all native English speakers -- but communication skills trump even technical skills for remote teams, so we all understand, speak and write English easily and with the confidence to interrupt if we didn't catch something. We collaborate, not compete -- let ideas fight it out, but we're on the same team. We like to laugh (but jokes stay tasteful), we share stories of what we did over the weekend (but these don't normally end \"then I passed out\").If we sound like a good match, get in touch:https://www.patientsknowbest.com/careers.html(I'm also contactable directly -- see profile -- but I get a lot of email). I do review all applications, though currently our hiring process is slow and with not-great communication; you should probably mention it if you think you're a great fit but need to jump to something immediately."

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We\u2019re self funded and doubling yearly.As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we\u2019re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We're currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We\u2019re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).We looking for four main strengths in you:\u25e6skill:your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.\u25e6desire to learn:despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.\u25e6understanding:our product team is great but not infallible. You\u2019ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users\u2019 best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.\u25e6clear communication:We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.So, if you\u2019ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you. Drop me an e-mail (robin at fireflylearning.com) or apply on our website \u2013http://fireflylearning.com/join-our-team/jobs/developer"

We are Expensify and we do \"expense reports that don't suck!\" (Google \"expensify\" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. We just went to Portugal...where do you want to go next?- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find athttp://we.are.expensify.com/apply). We are excited to hear from you!"

Sunnyvale.Application Security ConsultantFull-Time or Internship, work visa sponsorship available..............*________________________________________________________This thread will, no doubt, be dominated by posts with laundry lists of requirements. Many employers will introduce themselves by describing what they want from you. At Matasano, we're a little different. We like to start by telling you about us. This month, I want to try to do that by drawing analogy to Mission Impossible.What made the original show so great is exactly what was lost in the 'Tom Cruise takes on the world' reboot. The original 1960's and 70's Mission Impossible was defined primarily by a team working together against all odds to achieve their objective. It acknowledged that what they were doing was improbable, and more so for a solo James Bond or Tom Cruise character. As a team though, each character an expert in their particular focus area, the incredible became credible -- the impossible, possible.Working at Matasano is a bit like working for the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). No, we're not taking out thinly veiled cold war era Soviet stand in villains, preventing the rise of the third reich, or being tasked with gathering evidence against criminals \"outside the reach of conventional law enforcement.\" But in many cases, we're given tight timelines and tasked with difficult objectives. To the uninitiated, what we do is often seen as impossible, but _together_ we do it every day.Imagine you (and your team) have a month to circumvent a real world cryptographic system designed and sold for Fortune 500 companies to protect their most sensitive intellectual property. Maybe you're given a week to investigate and undercover flaws in a brand new Ruby on Rails application. You might find yourself facing a never-before-seen client/server application, implementing a proprietary binary protocol, and having to figure it out and attack it. You could end up drawing on binary reverse engineer skills, or reviewing Java code. But whatever the 'mission', you won't be alone. You'll be part of a team of experts, each bringing their own skill set to the team.We don't have very much call for demolitions experts, special effects makeup artists, or champion weightlifters. Like the IMF, we're looking for people with diverse backgrounds who each bring something unique to the team. There's little in computing that isn't useful for an Application Security Consultant. We need Reverse Engineers. Developers of all backgrounds, Cryptographers, Electrical Engineers, you name it. We're as likely to hire a Mathematics PHD as a college drop out. Many of our best employees have little formal information technology background. In short, we come from a variety of backgrounds, but share one common trait -- We're curious about nearly everything, and have a wide base of knowledge, but have achieved mastery over one (or more) disciplines. These are the sorts of people the IMF built their team from, and they're the sort of people who we're looking for at Matasano.Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to visit www.matasano.com/careers to learn more and contact us. In the enclosed dossier, you'll find links to www.cryptopals.com and www.microcorruption.com which may be of interest. Further intelligence is available at the chargen.matasano.com blog, and you can always contact careers@matasano.com with any remaining questions. As always, should any member of your team be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions.This isn't Mission Difficult, it's Mission Impossible. Difficult should be a walk in the park for you.This tape will self destruct in five seconds. Good luck.________________________________________________________________--(BOOM)"

Our goal is that our services will isolate developers from having to worry about test resource\u2019s health and availability.In the larger scope of the role, you will be responsible for rethinking the assumptions behind how traditional database services were built and thinking how to build database services best suited for the cloud.

You will lead and be responsible for delivering some of our most strategic technical projects, deliver large scalable systems, design new software systems at the cutting edge of distributed database technology and have a significant bottom-line impact on our business and competitive position.As a Senior Engineer in AWS, you will be a part of the larger technical leadership community that forms the backbone of the company, plays a critical role in the broad business planning, working closely with senior executives, influences our long-term technical and business strategy, helps us hire talented team of engineers and ultimately enables us to deliver innovative new solutions rapidly.This position within the Database Services team represents a unique and rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor within a fast growing business and help shape the technology, product and the business. A successful candidate will bring deep technical and software expertise, strong business acumen and judgment, an ability to define visionary, ground breaking products, ability to hire and lead a team, desire to have an industry wide impact and ability to work within a fast moving, startup environment in a large company to rapidly deliver services that have a broad business impact."

You are going to be our sole data warehouse/BI engineer, designing and building a data warehouse and ETL process to answer the specific types of questions our business team has.For the right person, this position is an amazing opportunity to own a data warehouse operation entirely from start to finish. For the wrong person, this is being thrown in the deep end without a life jacket.The number one, very special skill we're looking for here is a talent for getting to the heart of and asking the question the stakeholder isreallytrying to work out, rather than answering the one they've thought to ask. You won't be insulated by a layer of business analysts. You'll be working directly with our operations, marketing, and accounting people to get them the data they need. They're smart people who are highly capable of working with numbers, but they don't necessarily understand databases or all the ways they can use data to get the answers they need.Of course, you'll also need strong enough programming chops and sufficient understanding of dimensional modeling and data pipelines (in a Linux ecosystem, and ideally AWS) to design and implement from scratch an OLAP database and the ETL processing to populate it.You'll be expected to work independently and manage your own work. We're a very small engineering team, and each member is almost entirely self-managing -- we can't afford a lot of process overhead, let alone micromanagement. You'll have a team of intelligent, deeply technical engineers to talk things through with, but no one else on the team will be working directly on the same projects, and none of us have a deep background in the technologies and processes you're implementing.It's not a requirement, but the ideal candidate would also be comfortable with enough web development to be able to jump into our front-end (JS w/ Backbone and React) and back-end (Python/Django) codebases to add and adjust event tracking code as needed without having to wait for the web team.

We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines.- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find athttp://we.are.expensify.com/apply). We are excited to hear from you!"

You\u2019ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.\u25e6 clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s planned, you\u2019ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what\u2019s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we\u2019re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you\u2019ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.

        "content": "Lead of ML at Jungla -Jungla\u2019s mission is to ensure we all find meaningful answers to the increasing number of questions we ask of our genomes as patients. Personalized medicine depends upon accurately finding and interpreting our genetic differences. While technological advances have revolutionized our ability to find these differences, genetic tests often fail to interpret these differences, leading to inconclusive results and clinical uncertainty. This is both a limitation of existing data and approaches. Jungla\u2019s strategy unites experts in functional genomics, computational biophysics, and machine learning to develop proprietary solutions for genetic interpretation. The guiding principles at Jungla are rooted in knowledge generation, performance, scalability, and transparency. Our team strives to make genetic tests more useful, faster, and less expensive.What You'll Do: Help patients better leverage their genomic information across a wide-array of genetic and genomic tests. To achieve this, you will develop new models and systems that learn from diverse and increasingly complex computational and experimental data types. Help establish and promote a culture of engineering excellence.Ownership and Direction: Alongside the cofounders \u20133 ex-Stanford PhDs and postdocs\u2013 you will be instrumental to both problem definition and solution development.Engineering Excellence: You will set the software engineering tone for our small team, establishing continuous integration practices in an agile environment.Technical Development: You will drive architecture, algorithms development and implementation of critical components of Jungla\u2019s ambitious technical roadmap.

Our data is different from established areas of ML/DL application (like computer vision or natural language processing), so you\u2019ll need to derive effective hyperparameters and architectures for different learning problems and data types.You care about code: You take pride in development and have a deep understanding of how to write high quality, maintainable, extensible software. You have built tools in a production software engineering environment, including use of automated regression testing, version control, and deployment systems.You own your work: You\u2019re a steward of excellence who can identify, prioritize, manage and execute goals that impact the team\u2019s mission.Why You'll Love Working at Jungla: We combine competitive compensation and benefits with the opportunity to work on challenging and worthwhile problems.

We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following: - An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more. - A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next? - Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table. - Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That\u2019s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it\u2019s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I\u2019m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don\u2019t accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find athttp://we.are.expensify.com) or email us at jobs@expensify.com.

We founded this startup to address logistics challenges we've faced since we started Experior nearly 20 years ago. It turns out most of our trucking competitors face the same problems, and the industry at-large isn't making much progress to solve them. The solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential. The founders have a good understanding of both the logistics industry, trucking, and programming - so working with us isn't going to be an exercise in dealing with a pointy-haired boss with an MBA. We believe in, preach, and practice solid development behaviors that minimize technical debt and increase the probability of a high-quality product. We also believe in independence and accountability - not looking to add 'babysitter' to anyone\u2019s job description here.We've been trying to tackle these problems in some fashion for many years, but development only really picked up in the last year. Right now, we've got a remote team of 10, but we're looking to build a local team here in Chicago - the complex nature of the problems and the domain means we're really going to benefit from having a solid core group with plenty of face-time.WHAT YOU\u2019LL DOHelp design and build the core architecture that drives our platform Tackle problems unique to integrating big data Build multiple new and enhance existing nascent decoupled services that make up our platform Occasionally put your full-stack hat on and add or update pieces of our AngularJS front-endWHAT YOU\u2019LL NEEDSeveral years of Scala experience Experience building applications with Talent for creative and functional solutions to difficult problems Strong computer science fundamentals Excellent grasp and evidence of practicing outstanding software engineering practices: designing software, automated testing, continuous integration, automated deployments, code reviews, and more A stomach for working in rapidly evolving and often uncertain and complex problem domain Ability to ship quality code quickly and strong judgement on making good decisions to iterate on codeBIG PLUSSES IF YOU BRING THESE TOOAkka and Scala Play experience Data processing with Apache Beam/Spark/Dataflow Event Sourcing / CQRS experience Experience with real-time web applications (i.e. Socket.IO, Firebase, Meteor, and/or others) Experience, interest, and appreciation in several other languages and frameworks (i.e. Java, C#, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, C/C++, Assembler, and so forth) Big Data ExperienceCOMPENSATION, BENEFITS, PERKSCompetitive base salary Stock options Medical, dental, and other benefits Stocked kitchen Paid parking"

We are Expensify and we do \u201cexpense reports that don\u2019t suck!\u201d (Google \u201cexpensify\u201d to read more.) We\u2019re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren\u2019s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:- An incredibly hard worker, even when it\u2019s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all \u2014 we do the sucky work so our customers won\u2019t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn\u2019t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We\u2019ve done Cambodia, Thailand, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and Uruguay. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?- Super talented, in a general way. We\u2019re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job \u2014 you\u2019re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL \u2014 not because you know them all, but because you\u2019re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.If you\u2019re this sort of person, you\u2019ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn\u2019t for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying.

Replacing textbooks with tablets won\u2019t be enough. We believe schools need a new foundation. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building a web-based school scheduling platform, that allows administrators to put master schedules and daily calendars into a single cloud-based system. We are creating the next generation of software for all K12 schools to fundamentally change how they design, measure and improve their schools. We are also a company that deeply values diversity in every way.View openings, including sales, engineering, customer success, and design on our site:https://ablschools.com/careers/--------------------------------------------------Personal note: I've been on the Abl engineering team for over a year and I love it. The mission and the team make coming into work _awesome_. We have a diverse team, we're well funded, we have experienced leadership... I could go on. The interview process is, in my opinion, very fair. You won't be asked to white board and we understand that the process is just as much the candidate getting to know the company as it is the other way around.If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me - my contact info is in my profile.--------------------------------------------------Sr. Data Scientist:The RoleWe are looking for an experienced Data Scientist, and in this role, you will help schools understand the impact operational changes have on their students and staff.

You will be the second Data Scientist at Abl and will work across the product and business.As a data team, our goal is to produce software and insights that are proactive, guiding our peers and school leaders towards the right thing to do next, rather than taking a reactive view or simply describing what has been done. For the current stage of our business, our domain, and our customers, we have found that a bias towards reproducible, and more easily interpretable models and metrics is more useful than attempting to ruthlessly optimize an algorithm.Responsibilities+ Build underlying systems that power our data-driven products (e.g., recommendation engines, constraint solvers, and predictive models)+ Consult directly with school leaders to work on complex problems within Abl\u2019s product using your research and rapid prototyping skills to push new features into production+ Perform data profiling, complex sampling, and statistical modeling+ Design and develop tailored data models for K12 schools+ Identify incomplete data, improve the quality of data, and integrate data from several data sources+ Work on the challenge of combining data from across schools and districts, who all store things differently, so that we can measure our impact in aggregate+ Determine how to evaluate equity, or fairness, for students and for teachers+ Propose metrics for evaluating the overall quality of a schedule and methods for comparing multiple schedules\u2019 ability to meet school leader priorities+ Find trends and insights in complex, human-generated school dataQualifications+ Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, and/or JavaScript)+ Proficiency in writing SQL queries+ Ability and desire to present complex findings in a simple, approachable way for non-technical audiences (e.g., in writing, through reporting tools, and at in-person presentations)+ Experience with cleaning, structuring, and transforming data via ETL processes+ Ability to design and deploy machine learning algorithms and models--------------------------------------------------Sr. Front-End Engineer:We are seeking a Front-End Software Engineer to join our team and help build products that support our mission.

That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm.We are four years into a period of transformation from what was initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager. [Amaury Sechet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR4PSExnqk), [Andrei Alexandrescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U7WAlKpQ) and [Atila Neves](https://dlang.org/blog/2019/10/15/my-vision-of-ds-future/) have been working with us as long-term consultants and we have many other talented people with lower public profiles.It's not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming, but are oriented towards solving business problems, with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that's now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it.

        "content": "Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote (US only)| Full-time | ONSITE (fully-remote now) | Visa TransferIn the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that\u2019s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.Open positions include:* Software Engineers - Backend / Full Stack (All levels from Jr to TL/Staff Software Engineer)* Staff Front End Software Engineer* Software Development in Test | Sr. QA Automation Engineer* Senior UX Designer / Data Visualization* Product Manager* Product Support Engineer* Health Data Analysts* Technical Program ManagersJobs Board:https://bit.ly/nuna-jobsBackend Tech Stack: AWS, Clickhouse, Java, Spark, Scala, Python, GoWeb Tech Stack: Django, React, TypescriptQuestions?

If so, we would like to hear from you.- Business: risk, operations, administrative, organisational design and business strategy, investor relations processes- Investment: Economics, Quant, Portfolio Research, Investment Research, Portfolio Management and Trading- Market Data: contract administration, data cleaning, alternative data research and managementLocation: Remote or sponsorship for a visa in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, JerseyTerm: full-time permanent, fixed-term contract, flexible hours.## Languages- Dlang (D)- Typescript- Kotlin- we do not use but value experience in modern C++, beautiful C, Haskell, Ocaml, Rust, Elm## Qualities and traits we value- Courage and daring- Phronesis (practical wisdom), common sense and commercial orientation- Practical people who are at the same time unreasonable when they ought to be- Highly individual people oriented to promoting survival and flourishing of the group- Inclination and ability to notice and understand links between seemingly-unrelated things- Curiosity- Extreme motivation- Mechanical sympathy- Extreme and unusual intellectual capabilities- A love of tinkering- Resourcefulness- Good taste and love of beauty## About UsSymmetry Investments is a post startup USD 9+ billion alternative asset management company with around 250 people across multiple time zones and locations.Our core technology team has been remote-first for some time, and the whole company is following suit, accelerated by the pandemic.I'm co-CEO and co-COO, responsible amongst other things for technology across the firm and I\u2019m posting this myself. That should give you an idea both about how seriously we take technology and the culture of the firm.We are five years into a period of transformation from what was initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager. [Amaury Sechet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR4PSExnqk), [Andrei Alexandrescu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U7WAlKpQ) and [Atila Neves](https://dlang.org/blog/2019/10/15/my-vision-of-ds-future/) have been working with us as long-term consultants and we have many other talented people with lower public profiles.It's not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming, but are oriented towards solving business problems, with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that's now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. SIL can compile and call C++, D, and C# at runtime and interoperate with Python and R.What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.The language is written in D and we have a close involvement with the D Foundation and community, hosting DConf in London. So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.It's quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it's commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren't a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We've recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Haskell, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use.Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards. We recognise and reward technical accomplishment and have a very flat structure - don't be surprised if our founder and Chief Investment Officer starts asking you questions about your work.## Symmetry Talks- Presenting SIL-cling to Compiler Research Group at Princeton (https://youtu.be/7teqrCNzrD8)- Symmetry Internship Project - calling C++ from SIL (http://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html#alexandru)- All Spreadsheets Must Die (https://youtu.be/FZi9CSB9_kk)- Lessons from a DSL where all you have is Ranges (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA)- Alternative Investment Management (https://youtu.be/1rMq-4rWgis)## Links- Symmetry GitHub (https://github.com/symmetryinvestments)# Contact- Please apply using this link (https://jobs.lever.co/symmetryinvestments/c8a9b95e-bdf0-459c...)."

Our experience has been that strong C and C++ developers can learn D quite quickly.- Functional programmers to work with practitioners in delivering value to the business using Symmetry Integration Language.- Documentation: At Symmetry we recognise the value of writing and have for example a Pulitzer prize-winning former WSJ journalist and a maintainer of Linux Kernel Newbies documentation. We are looking for people to write technical documentation and to document data structures and processes (open to varying range of technical ability depending on the project).- Front end design: designers - ideally with some ability to program - to work on usability and aesthetics for our applications and other information-presenting systems, on both web and desktop- Designers for documentation: Now that non-programming internal work is moving to markdown in git, we are hiring designers to work on templates and mini-logos for documentation and other work.- Data Science: time series analysis in particular, including high frequency data sets that are too big for simple tools- Information Security: incident response, threat intelligence, vuln management- Platform: Platform as Code, Site Reliability Engineers, Windows desktop support; frontline server support and administration; application support- Legal and Compliance: #lawyerswhocode or who are very comfortable working with markdown in git- Accounting: are you the sort of person who would use #ledger-cli ? If so, we would like to hear from you.- Business: risk, operations, administrative, organisational design and business strategy, investor relations processes, talent acquisition, human resources (HR)- Investment: Economics, Quant, Portfolio Research, Investment Research, Portfolio Management and Trading- Market Data: contract administration, data cleaning, alternative data research and managementLocation: Remote or sponsorship for a visa in London, Hong Kong, Singapore, JerseyTerm: full-time permanent, fixed-term contract, flexible hours.## Languages- Dlang (D)- Typescript- Kotlin- we do not use but value experience in modern C++, beautiful C, Haskell, Ocaml, Rust, Elm## Qualities and traits we value- Courage and daring- Phronesis (practical wisdom), common sense and commercial orientation- Practical people who are at the same time unreasonable when they ought to be- Highly individual people oriented to promoting survival and flourishing of the group- Inclination and ability to notice and understand links between seemingly-unrelated things- Curiosity- Extreme motivation- Mechanical sympathy- Extreme and unusual intellectual capabilities- A love of tinkering- Resourcefulness- Good taste and love of beauty## About UsSymmetry Investments is a post startup multi-billion alternative asset management company with 250+ people across multiple time zones and locations.Our core technology team has been remote-first for some time, and the whole company is following suit, accelerated by the pandemic.We are five years into a period of transformation from what was initially a fairly standard enterprise finance technology approach to something new that recognises the importance of both the humane and the technical for discretionary portfolio management and for the business of running an alternative investment manager. [Amaury Sechet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhR4PSExnqk) and [Atila Neves](https://dlang.org/blog/2019/10/15/my-vision-of-ds-future/) have been working with us as long-term consultants and we have many other talented people with lower public profiles.It's not easy to integrate practitioners who may spend most of their day programming, but are oriented towards solving business problems, with developers who are specialists in programming. To achieve this, we wrote a little functional DSL that's now in production. Type inference of returns and parameters using inequality constraints is in a feature branch and there is plenty more to do on the language itself as well as the ecosystem around it. SIL can compile and call C++, D, and C# at runtime and interoperate with Python and R. What might be a project in itself elsewhere can be just a set of functions in Symmetry Integration Language.The language is written in D and we have a close involvement with the D Foundation and community, hosting DConf in London. So we are looking for outstanding native code developers who would like to write D as well as people to work with practitioners writing Symmetry Integration Language. Also looking for people to write documentation and work on the build.It's quite a creative place where we encourage a degree of courage amidst practical constraints, and we are open to doing things a different way if it's commercially sound and in the interests of our investors.We look for virtues and capabilities over only experience and credentials although those things aren't a disadvantage. Do not let a lack of credentials or qualifications prevent you from applying. We've recently hired experts with C++, Common Lisp, D, Haxe, Haskell, Julia and Perl backgrounds, and are happy to bring them up to speed with the tools we use.Compensation is currently not quite at Netflix standards but is generous to very generous over time by broad technology industry standards. We recognise and reward technical accomplishment and have a very flat structure - don't be surprised if our founder and Chief Investment Officer starts asking you questions about your work.## Symmetry Talks- Presenting SIL-cling to Compiler Research Group at Princeton (https://youtu.be/7teqrCNzrD8)- Symmetry Internship Project - calling C++ from SIL (http://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html#alexandru)- All Spreadsheets Must Die (https://youtu.be/FZi9CSB9_kk)- Lessons from a DSL where all you have is Ranges (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtuzSlKRmzA)- Alternative Investment Management (https://youtu.be/1rMq-4rWgis)## Links- Symmetry GitHub (https://github.com/symmetryinvestments)# Contact- Please apply using this general link (https://jobs.lever.co/symmetryinvestments/c8a9b95e-bdf0-459c...) or to specific roles listed here (https://jobs.lever.co/symmetryinvestments?lever-source%5B%5D...)."

Our philosophy on hiring is that the candidate is more important than the position. For each new member of the team, we design a custom role and responsibilities that are specialized to their interests. Other companies will come up with a long list of specific requirements for a position with the expectation that you'll exactly replace someone from the team, or that you'll be the perfect tetris piece that satisfies the job requirements decided by a committee.

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.
