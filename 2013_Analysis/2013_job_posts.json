Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines.

We\u2019ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.We\u2019re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.We\u2019re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.We\u2019re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.We care about documentation:https://layer.com/docs/ios.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.We care about design.  We won\u2019t be releasing our own apps - that\u2019s up to our customers - but we\u2019ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we don\u2019t have the keys we can\u2019t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)Today we're a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. We\u2019re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.  We hold the power to dramatically improve the way 2 billion+ Internet users communicate.We\u2019re well funded and have already assembled an early team that shows we mean business. We\u2019ve started and built world-class companies and highly scalable Internet infrastructure and invented protocols used by millions.Get in touch: jobs at layer dot com",

                "SpaceX - Los Angeles, CAhttp://www.spacex.com/careersWe seek to accelerate the course of human history by developing the technologies necessary for multi-planetary civilization.We build rockets and spacecraft from the ground up, utilizing much of our own electronics, software, vehicle structures, and engine systems. The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn\u2019t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.When considering you as a candidate, we won\u2019t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you\u2019re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you\u2019re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You\u2019re the engineer that other engineers can count on\u2014you\u2019re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team\u2019s passionate dedication to the mission.At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and \u201claunching\u201d the product will be like no other product launch you\u2019ve ever experienced!\nNote for new or recent graduates: If you\u2019re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com. Thanks!",

                "DaisyBill - 34 W 15th Street, NYC -http://www.daisybill.comSenior Ruby/Rails/JS developer, full-time and local onlyDaisyBill does workers' compensation e-billing for the state of California.We're a small company with 5 people in NYC and 2 in California.Workers' Comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that performs services on the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims/bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.Effective October 18, 2012, all claims administrators (insurance companies, self-insured employers, et al) for California workers compensation claims are required to be able to receive bills electronically.DaisyBill is the facilitator for practices to take advantage of this new law, allowing them to enter in the information about services rendered, seeing both what they should charge for the services and what they should expect to be paid (as these are not always the same). DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper/snail mail. We're talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more. This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.--We're looking for someone to help us with a new product/revenue stream we're going to be developing shortly. This product is a new fee calculator as the current one is expiring after the new year. We're also going to be integrating with third party billers that are currently unable to submit workers comp bills electronically. There is no shortage of work to be done and there is a lot of money to be made.I'm Kris, the CTO and sole developer at DaisyBill. Previously I was at ThoughtWorks, then Pivotal Labs. I decided to get out of consulting and into a product company because I wanted to own the product I was working on. DaisyBill is the only company out of many I considered that has a solid business plan with an intent to make a lot of money and do some good in the process.I'm looking for a senior developer that is experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. The stack we currently run is Rails 3.2/PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku. I'd like to rewrite the site using AngularJS at some point in the near future, so Angular experience is a plus. We also don't have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX/UI is also a plus. We use Git and I'd expect any new hire to either already know Git quite well or be unafraid of it and be able to be brought up to speed quickly. I currently develop on an iMac with MacVim, and most people in the office use a standing desk.You would be pairing reasonably regularly for the first few weeks but be expected to work independently not long after joining, asking questions as necessary. We also do a loose form of TDD: I typically like to sketch out an idea before trying to bake it in with tests. I also don't test every line of code. I believe in being pragmatic about testing. We use RSpec and Jasmine.I do interviews similarly to the way they're done at Pivotal: After chatting about what you're looking for in a position I'd have you come in and pair on some code. I care a lot about the interview process allowing the candidate to suss out whether the work environment and the actual work is what they're interested in. I don't do conference room whiteboard programming.I don't have a degree, and I don't expect you to have one, either. I don't necessarily care about how long you've been a developer, either. I care about the quality of your code today and your approach to solving problems. If you're capable and can show it, I'm interested.You may reach me at khicks@daisybill.com.Cheers.",

The industry is ripe for innovation! We're building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for months now.\nI know 'app for laundry' is a tech clich\u00e9 right now, but we're definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we're solving it.The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition. I'm Stanford CS/EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business. The tech stack is Heroku / Python / Django / Celery / Phonegap / JQuery / Backbone / Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.We're looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements. Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.We're also looking for a Director of Marketing. Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and 'growth hacking.' We're building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business.

If you don't know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they're probably the only folks around who might get the intricacies of what you're excited about)We're looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you're a Senior Engineer - you've worked in server-side code for a few years. You've scaled to thousands or millions of users. You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.If you're a Junior engineer, you love to code and you're good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited. (New grads please apply!)Android and IOS engineers:You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience.

Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines.

                "Square \u2014 NYChttps://squareup.com/---Square! In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.As a company, we have four main focuses.Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were \"non-consumers\" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (http://squareup.com/market) and Square Cash (http://squareup.com/cash), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.If you're interested; I'd love to chat.

                "New York / London - Bloomberghttp://jobs.bloomberg.com/http://www.bloomberg.com/uxThere are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I'm particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R&D. We have roughly 4,000 R&D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level \"app\" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion \"ticks\" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one \"feed\") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)We could use a motto like \"We do a lot of stuff.\"Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I'll be sponsoring / attending RobotsConf in December, too.",

We turn out products, about 3-4 per year, based on our own ideas. The ones that go well, we reinvest in. Those that don't, we bury in the yard. We also invest in, mentor, and incubate local startups targeting the Latin American market. We're at the center of the rapidly emerging startup boom in Mexico. Mostly though, we have a lot of fun.We're giving a few developers the opportunity to rethink their life priorities and get out of Dodge for a while. You're startup is flagging? Sick of the fog? Commute got you down? Just broke up with your partner? Why not pull the rip cord and come work with us for a while?What do we have to offer?\n* A vibrant, biggish (pop. 4M), student-oriented city, that's full of hip bars, restaurants, and (really) beautiful, friendly people.\n* A work environment that is, hands down, the hippest place to work in Mexico. Imagine programming in the hammock - poolside (yes, we have a pool).\n* Use of the beach house. We have a 3 story beach house with all mod cons, 20 feet from a graceful, immaculate sandy bay in a small fishing village. Also, one of the premier left point surf breaks is 5 minutes away by boat (which we also have).\n* A chance to learn (or practice your Spanish).\n* An opportunity to be at ground zero for one of the most vibrant and rapidly expanding startup scenes in the world.\n* Beef up your resume with experience in navigating the business climate in Mexico and Latin America.\n* and, finally, ALMOST NO MONEY. Okay, not entirely true - you'll be paid a very tidy wage (by mexican standards) which will allow you to live well here - most things are cheap here. However, if you compare what you'll make here versus what you're making now? It will be a disappointing exercise. Said differently, if money is what you're after - then this is not for you. If you're looking for adventure, fun, and to challenge your self with something new - welcome to your new home!!!Who are we looking for? It's all listed on the website:http://www.agavelab.com/hiring/but in summary:\nHTML/CSS/Javascript kung fu\nMobile dev skills (android or iOS)\nServer dev skills\nCommunity managers/growth hackingOur technology stack is HTML5, CSS3, Java, NodeJS, MongoDB, Play Framework, Scala. But don't worry if you don't know these. As long as you have a very solid command of at least one programming language (Java, C, C++, Python, etc) and are smart as a whip, we can teach you the rest. We expect the same things that any software development shop would: ability to write clean, well-documented code, familiarity with Dev Environments (Xcode, CodeIgniter/Play/Angular/etc.), experience with Agile/Scrum concepts, etc. Culturally we look for self-starters that can thrive with very little guidance and who have a genuine passion of solving complex problems. You should also like beer (or not be afraid to watch others consume large quantities of it), music, the sun, and tacos.) Oh yes, and a sense of humor - you'll want to bring that too.\nYou want to know more? Of course you do. Check out the site: www.agavelab.com or drop us an email.

Our test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 12% of all carrier screens in the United States.The cost of sequencing human genomes is plunging - over 5x faster than the cost of computing; the potential impact on preventive healthcare and the medical landscape is boundless.

                "NYC and Washington, DC.\nFull-time and internship.The Go Circuit (http://gocircuit.org) is hiring Systems Engineers.Original job posting:http://blog.gocircuit.org/job-system-engineerPROJECTThe Go Circuit is a development, distribution and execution environment for a new generation of self-sustained distributed applications. The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company's infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.RESPONSIBILITIESFull-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.QUALIFICATIONSThe ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:* Full-time candidates should have B.A./B.Sc., M.A./M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.* Four or more years of experience with a low-level/systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don't need to be a specialist.)* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.* Ability to read academic publications in Computer ScienceMost importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.COMPENSATIONCompensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists. That said, compensation and benefits will be on par with the standard amongst institutions like Google, IBM, Microsoft and such.\nLocationTo apply, please, send your vitae and anything else you want to say to Petar at p@gocircuit.org.",

That's a simple statement, but if you dig deeper, there's a lot to it. It says that we think they're smart. And that we could learn from them. And that they could learn from us. And that we get along, and they fit our culture. And they're passionate about our product like we are. And of course - that they also want to work with us.Our interviews are fun - at least we think so. They're largely modeled after largely after Google interviews (there's a lot of Google interviewing experience in our team). Questions are either real problems we've had to solve (probably recently) or some abstractification of a bigger problem to see how you attack problems in general (with the \"getting the right answer\" not being the interesting part of the interview).Specifically - We're looking for:Backend Developers:You're a crackshot in your backend language of choice. As I said, we're building a system that does an incredible amount of work all while the user is waiting for it to complete - so needless to say, we're looking for people who care about performance. A lot.Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you're willing to learn. If you don't know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they're probably the only folks around who might get the intracacies of what you're excited about)We're looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you're a Senior Engineer - you've worked in server-side code for a few years. You've scaled to thousands or millions of users.  You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.If you're a Junior engineer, you love to code and you're good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited.  (New grads please apply!)Android and IOS engineers:You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience.

                "AppDynamics -- San Francisco, CA -- H1B welcomeAppDynamics is a successful, well-funded startup in Application Performance Management space. Our product and business model are proving to be quite disruptive in a very large market. Companies like Netflix, Priceline.com, Deutsche Bank, Williams Sonoma, Betfair and Expedia are using AppDynamics to ensure the performance and availability of their revenue-critical applications.AppDynamics' traditional products for JVM, CLR, PHP and Node.js kick ass at measuring server-side performance across your app. But with the shift to highly interactive websites and mobile apps, an increasing number of performance problems are caused by client-side code or internet latency. End-User Monitoring measures the performance that your real users' experience by instrumenting client-side platform APIs. EUM complements server-side monitoring, but comes with its own set of challenges:* Client-side platforms are not designed for easy instrumentation. How can we extract meaningful performance data from web browsers, iOS, and Android?* Client-side performance performance is confounded by the huge variability in devices, workloads, and network latency. How can we make sense of this complex, noisy, multi-dimensional data?* How can we cope with the volume of performance data flooding in from millions/billions of users?* How can we incorporate client-side and server-side data into a complete picture of app performance?Here are the components of our system, and what it takes to work on them:Browser Agent:* Write fast, bulletproof instrumentation for JavaScript that can run inside any web app across hundreds of browser versions.* Understand behavioral and performance idiosyncrasies of various browsers.* Incorporate new timing specifications from W3C performance working group, but develop fallback timing techniques for other browsers.Mobile Agents:* Build fast, bulletproof instrumentation for iOS (Objective-C) and Android (Java) platform APIs that can run inside any app across thousands of devices.* Understand mobile app architecture and frameworks, identify strategies to extract user actions, performance and system crash data.* Understand iOS, Android, and Dalvik internals, and the characteristics and constraints of mobile platforms in general.Cloud:* This is the processing platform that receives data from the agents. It's a scalable data processor and analytics engine (think real-time map/reduce) built on Amazon Web Services.* Process billions of end-user requests from some of the biggest sites in the world.* Scale with AWS infrastructure components (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, EMR, etc).* Ensure zero downtime, zero data loss, continuous deployment, multi tenant, multi \nversion, etc.* Analyze huge volumes of data with statistical techniques, machine learning, predictive analysis.UI:* Design and build learnable, usable, data-rich HTML5 UI that helps users discover, triage, and root-cause performance problems.* We use AngularJS and TypeScript.I work in the EUM team and we are looking to expand. If you have skills or interest pertaining to any of the above-mentioned areas, please write to me at bthomas@appdynamics.com",

                "Fetchnotes - Cambridge, MA. Interns and full-time. We make your notes and to do lists better, not just better organized.We have a really simple and effective product for keeping track of reminders, ideas, etc., but what I think is really exciting about our business is the R&D we're doing to automate those things or find relevant context/information.For example, you write down a book you want to look up, and we show you where you can find it. You have a grocery list, we let you know when you're within a block of a store that has those items. The possibilities are endless, and there's just as much product strategy that needs to be determined there as there is code. But we believe that productivity software can do so much more than empower the procrastination they do today.Looking to add engineers with experience in mobile development (Android in particular), JavaScript (we use Angular, but experience with another framework like Backbone or Ember will suffice), machine learning and natural language processing. As far as NLP goes, we're doing some really unique things that involve more statistics than typical NLP toolkits, so a good stats background will be helpful.Backed by TechStars Boston and a group of fantastic angel investors and venture capitalists, we're a young, close-knit and energetic team of 6 who believe that simple products, engineered properly, can make a big impact on people's lives. We hang out after work frequently, have dinner together at least weekly, and are genuinely friends (not just co-workers). After big releases, we'll usually take the day off to do something fun like laser tag or kayaking. I believe in hiring people that I want to work with over the course of a career, not just for a particular role today. At the end of every interview I ask myself, \"In 10 years, will I regret not having had the opportunity to work with this person?\"Also, we were #2 on Hacker News last year when we accidentally called 2,000 people bitches:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557813Sound interesting?

Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.As a company, we have four main focuses.Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&B numbers and such.Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were \"non-consumers\" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (http://squareup.com/market) and Square Cash (http://squareup.com/cash), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.If you're interested; I'd love to chat.

We want your help scaling our thousands of events per second and terabytes of data. If you're a fan of distributed systems and like to stress-test a new database every other week, you'll fit right in. And it won't hurt if you like streams, trying out ES6 features, and open-sourcing your work.Our entire backend runs on Node, with a sprinkling of Redis, Mongo, and RabbitMQ. We're open to running a variety of languages and could still use someone to show our Go and Erlang libraries some love.Think that might tickle your fancy? We've got a few projects in the pipeline that you can sink your teeth into right away:Live Debugger\nYou'll build a system that helps developers debug requests to the Segment.io API, and whether the request has been successfully routed to all its destinations. The fun part of this one is working at a variety of scale (isn't it always?). You'll have to build a system which helps devs debug on localhost, but also help them monitor production environments sending 500 requests a second.MapReduce for All\nWe'd love to have a way for developers to query the terabytes of analytics data stored in the Segment.io data warehouse. Can you streamline the process until your mother can submit mapreduce queries with ease?Data Export APIs\nPerhaps you'd like to build an API to export analytics data from Amazon S3 (or maybe even Glacier?). Exporting will have to stream terabytes of data without waking our ops guys in the middle of the night. Then, you'll deploy the system to EC2 and test it, and announce it to the world!To apply, email us at jobs+backend@segment.io with:- a description of your own favorite software project (code is a bonus)\n  - a link to your Github (if you have one)\n  - what languages and frameworks you like to use, and why\n  - any bash command you'd probably use to inspect a logfile-----Mobile EngineerWith our new iOS and Android SDKs we want to change the mobile analytics game. The market is flooded with new mobile analytics startups, but underneath they all collect the same data. And anytime you make an analytics change, you have to re-submit your app to the app store. Bummer. :'(Developers can drop in our SDK and then later enable any of Segment.io\u2019s dozens of analytics integrations without writing additional code or even submitting updates to the app store. Both iOS and Android SDKs are open source, so you'll be working closely with the rest of the community (and get a great chance to show off your work).Here's some examples of what you'd probably tackle at Segment.io:Best New Tools\nAs the maintainer of the SDKs, you'd have total control over which analytics tools get added and distributed across millions of devices. What are the best new tools? Something for an interesting new app category? Help our users find the best-in-breed mobile analytics tools, and build them into the SDKs so that they can enable them instantly.Community Distribution\nAs Segment.io's mobile expert, you'll be guiding (and helping write!) lots of the mobile content marketing we produce. We want you to become the world's leading expert on mobile analytics, knowing the business models, industry, tools and problems inside and out. We'll help propel you to become a thought leader in a brand new field.Xbox, Playstation, Roku\nYou could also play around on new platforms, bringing analytics bliss to the home entertainment world and gaming platforms.To apply, email us at jobs+mobile@segment.io with:- a description of an app you worked on (code is a bonus)\n  - a link to your Github if you have one\n  - the most interesting mobile SDK you've worked with and why-----Customer EngineerAt Segment.io, customer support drives the focus of the entire team.

Are you suave, courteous, and patient? :)You'll be responsible for analyzing our richest source of data: support requests. \"Where is support coming from? Why do customers need help? Which parts of the product need the most love?\" You'll be in charge of automating as much of that as possible without sacrificing quality.Currently we get about 40 support requests per day. Here's the breakdown:35% are variations of \"thanks your product is super awesome!\" which are fun.\n25% are technical support requests for our main javascript library. You might have to jump on Skype with a Ukrainian developer or a Japanese designer (watch the timezone!) or maybe run down the street to help a local startup.\n15% are technical problems with our mobile libraries for iOS and Android.\n10% require debugging a server-side integration: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, or Node.\n5% are completely confused, but we still <3 them.\nand the remaining 10% are hiring, sales and other random inquiries.\nThis kind of analysis should feel natural to you!Your analysis of support issues, feature requests, and customer feedback will be absolutely critical to planning tasks with the rest of the team.

Academia.edu's goal is to fix the problems in science so that science becomes faster and more open. We want to get every science pdf ever written on the internet, accessible for free.Academia.edu is a platform where a scientist can share their research with their followers, and track how many people are reading their research, and from which countries. These metrics help move the needle for scientists when they apply for jobs and grants, and motivate them to share more of their work.A leading climate scientist in Germany wrote \"Academia.edu shows the impact of your work that is not covered by Web of Science and citation indexes of that sort. With Web of Science you only learn how many people have quoted what. But with Academia.edu I can see what is viewed, what is actually read or not. Here I learn something additional, something I would not know otherwise.\u201d4.5 million academics have signed up to Academia.edu, and around 1 million join every 3 months. Currently scientists have uploaded 1.6m papers, of the 57 million papers ever published. The number of papers on Academia.edu is doubling every 7 months. Come and help us get to 57 million papers.Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes \"We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.\"We are looking for full-stack engineers, and also designers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. We are a 10 person team based in downtown San Francisco.

As a Principal Technical Consultant, you're responsible for creating and implementing cutting-edge technology solutions for our customers whilst driving software excellence to influence and shape the wider software industry as well as our business.As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here's what we'll be looking for you to bring:- You love coding. Even if your recent roles have taken you away from being as hands-on as you might like, you've no doubt found other ways to keep your coding skills from getting too rusty and we expect that you'll have had exposure to recent technologies. \n- You have a rich breadth of experience and are equally comfortable talking financial projections or business process modelling as you are advocating for TDD.\n- You really understand the business context of the challenges that organisations face and distinguish yourself in the way you articulate this with clients to create and deliver robust, scalable, elegant, flexible and relevant software solutions that truly transform industries.\n- Leadership is not something you do from far away, you get the importance of taking people with you along the journey and are able to influence and coach those around you to orchestrate team success.As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here\u2019s what you can do:- Directly guide the technical strategy for one of the world\u2019s largest airlines. Build out a new capability within ThoughtWorks - perhaps for Mobile, Big Data or DevOps. Explore ways to improve our business relevance for customers. Create and implement an original tech solution to manage high broadcasts for a new live sports coverage.

Deliver the new technology platform for a government agency providing tailored information to the public's needs. Speak at conferences. Influence and shape our client portfolio. Get published.There's no typical day or engagement for our Principal Consultants. You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organisational review, helping them to understand the potential that technology has to solve their most pressing problems. On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a programme inception to build a new product. It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you're equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution. Whatever your role the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue building software without undue pressure. You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.You recognise that building your network is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role - and you appreciate that it might be tough initially to find your place in our incredibly flat-structured organisation.

                "Google - Madison, WI. Sorry, no remote work, but Google does sponsor visas. All levels of experience welcome. We've recently hired an ACM fellow, as well as a new college grad.Of course Google is hiring. So, why I posting this? Every time I tell someone I'm working at Google in Madison, they're shocked that there's an office in Madison, and I often hear people complaining about the lack of interesting technical work in Madison. There's fun technical work in Madison, I promise.I'm working on a hardware/software co-design project that's attacking a fundamentally hard problem, which started as a 20%-time project. There are a couple other hardware projects in the office; most hardware projects start as prototypes of crazy ideas, and go from there. The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google's next generation hardware and software platforms. I'm sorry I can't describe projects in much more detail -- Google is pretty secretive about what goes into datacenters.The office is small (just under 30 people), and manages to avoid any bureaucracy you might expect from a big company. The work is interesting enough that in the five year history of the office, only one person has left (and he retired to a ranch in Nebraska). Feel free to email me (see profile) if you have any questions.https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&jid=45087&https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&jid=2069001&Edit: Interesting to see this downvoted. If you're downvoting this, I'd be curious to know why. Because Madison is in the middle of nowhere and you don't care about Madison? Because you don't like big companies?

Remote might be possible.We are looking for Big Data Engineers, Data Hackers and Machine Learning Pragmatists. Example job description here:http://bottlenose.com/jobs/senior-big-data-engineer. But if you are hungry for challenges in the intersection of Big Data / Machine Learning. Talk to us. Contact me at dominiek at bottlenose dot com (Recruiters NOT OK).Bottlenose is headquartered in LA with a large part of the development team in Amsterdam. Technologies we use: Cassandra, Storm, Hadoop, MongoDB, Node.js.Our Vision:The Stream. It's what matters now. From email to tweets, from forum postings to customer complaints, from enterprise social to automated systems monitors, the drivers for business are now in vortex of voices reflecting markets, internal morale, innovation, brand equity, product acceptance, politics and threats. Rational intend has shifted to irrational actions. Understanding the past bares no guarantee for the future. Understanding what's actionable in streams after-the-fact is expensive. Even dangerous.This new paradigm requires new tools and methods that can make sense out of the stream and understand human emotion. Bottlenose\u2019s core technology - StreamSense -  creates a virtual mind map of everything people pay attention to. It is a new kind of database to derive powerful new insights. StreamSense gives organizations the emotional intelligence that they didn\u2019t have before. It allows them to sense what people are feeling and to anticipate the unknown unknowns - both the good and the bad.Attempts at creating machine understanding of our world like the Semantic Web and the Knowledge Graph have failed due to two fundamental flaws: 1) A model of the world is not something that should be derived from documents written by experts; 2) In order to build a \u2018global brain\u2019 you need to understand human emotion and human intend.Bottlenose\u2019s ultimate mission is to create a global artificial brain. This global consciousness is build out of a continuous stream of human conversation and attention. By analyzing these vast amounts of data and by analyzing the emotions around it, we build up a mental model of the world. We think this will give us a shot at creating an incredibly powerful Artificial General Intelligence.",

                "Moka5 - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns and H1Bs welcomeMoka5 makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you're not stuck carrying two laptops around.One product that's been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files on the go (even when you don't have a network connection), and currently getting ready to release a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There's also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we'll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!",

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research. 4.1m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.- Data-sets. Scientists don't share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.We're a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb.We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.\nWe are looking to hire software engineers to help build a faster and more open science.There is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring.

Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone.Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, \"there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things\" is spot on. Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users. You've built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead. Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.2) Head of Marketing & Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same.

                "San Francisco, CA - Full-time, permanent - MuleSoftSr. Javascript UI EngineerWhy should you join MuleSoft?Every major company is adopting more and more cloud services, AND building lots of apps themselves, AND publishing their own APIs. We're talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company's applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?\nAt MuleSoft, we're already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we're taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule \"bus\" to be the nexus of an entire enterprise's integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue.\nAnd that's why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.Where do you come in?First, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our CloudHub platform. Since it's a new product, there's very little legacy; and since we're still a startup, you get to be a big part of a small team with a very broad impact. This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.Second, you get to work on great technologies: single-page Ajax apps; client-side MVC using backbone.js building on RESTful back-end APIs; Twitter bootstrap and jQuery; LESS; grunt; node.js, of course; perhaps you'll bring in some other new technology to the stack.Finally, and maybe the coolest part: since Mule already has the world's biggest companies on board, CloudHub will have the backing of the biggest customers to drive adoption of standards, technologies, coding paradigms, etc. So this stuff is poised to make a huge impact.And you? You already know you can create killer UI's based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it's a given that you're a master of all things HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript. But isn't it time you turned your attention to a really, really big problem?Click here if you're interestedhttp://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=o9SBXfwj&s=ycombinator",

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research. 3.7m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.- Data-sets. Scientists don't share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.We're a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb.We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.We are looking to hire software engineers to help build a faster and more open science.There is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://techcrunch.com/2013/02/03/the-future-of-the-scientifi...(Reputation Metrics in Science)We will handle re-location, including visas.

Currently we have a few PhD's, few ex-googler's, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG (http://www.testng.org) and the guy who wrote Mailinator (http://mailinator.blogspot.com). And we're only up to 7 people.  But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.Job Description:  \nSomeone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.Our technology includes: \nJava. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every  superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)Job Requirements: \nYou know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold.  You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there.  You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.The interview:We love solving problems  and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code.  So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun.

You'd be responsible for all interaction and visual design in our products.Here's what we think is important about the role:\u2022 Code \u2013 You won't be expected to write production code, but you should know\n      your medium well: what's possible with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and what's easy \n      or hard.

We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover using our tools with one another.\nWhile there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone. Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, \"there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things\" is spot on. Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users. You've built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.\nOur FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.2) Head of Marketing & Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same. You're ready to join an extremely talented product & engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we're working on sounds intriguing, then we'd love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

You'll be familiar with PHP and have experience with front end development for dynamic content/apps, using JavaScript libraries like Backbone.js, AngularJS or Ember.js.Visualising Data. You'll have a keen interest in visualising datasets, with a good understanding of what makes information beautiful. You'll know that an infographic is only as good as the moment it was created.

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.\nIt's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science.

                "We Are Pop Up - London, UK - Web Application Developer (full-time)We Are Pop Up is a community-driven marketplace for short-term commercial property leasing. While we certainly didn't invent the concept of a \"pop up shop\", we're embracing it whole-heartedly as a solution to two social problems which have arisen in our  time: 1) How can we lower the barrier-to-entry to enable a new generation of retail, food, and creative entrepreneurs to operate as easily in the offline world as businesses currently do online? 2) As commerce increasingly moves online, vacant property is left behind, which can have detrimental effects on both the nearby businesses and the greater community alike. How can we find new ways of filling that space? The missing piece which transforms these two real problems into mutual solutions is an excellent software platform that removes the time and overhead typically associated with commercial leasing. We Are Pop Up officially launched this platform near the end of 2012, and has already given numerous creative entrepreneurs around the UK opportunities to engage the offline world in ways they never had before.We're looking for an experienced Web Application Developer to work directly along side our Lead Developer and Creative Director, building features and scaling the platform.

We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover using our tools with one another.While there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone.\nOur team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, \"there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things\" is spot on. Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users. You've built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.2) Head of Marketing & Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same. You're ready to join an extremely talented product & engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we're working on sounds intriguing, then we'd love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for people for three types of positions: web, EE, and ME.On the web side, we're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.On the hardware side, you'd be part of a small functional team (2-3 people) working on developing new hardware to solve specific problems.  We have in-house rapid prototyping and you'd also work with outsourced manufacture, whether in Sunnyvale or China.  Our MCAD is Solidworks-based; most people here use Eagle for electronics but that would be up to you.  Include a portfolio of projects you've worked on before; experience in robotics a major plus.  If you have HVAC experience, note the separately, too.  PhD is a plus but definitely not necessary.We're a small startup (you'd be #11), but well funded and have customers.

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)There is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/(The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers.

Interested in being part of a friendly, dynamic team in a central Cambridge studio? We want to talk to front or back end developers who are creative, organised and love all things web. Ideally you'll have some or all of the following skills:Knowledge of writing standards-compliant, high-performing HTML5 and CSS web pages. \nExperience of working with popular web libraries. We use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job. \nGood knowledge of at least one programming language. \nWe work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too. \nAn understanding of database programming and design. \nFamiliarity with *nix based operating systems. \nAwareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook. \nMore important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).> What you can expect to work onExpect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.> How we workAs a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.> LearningThe web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.> LifestyleWorking at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles. Just ten minutes walk from the station and ten minutes walk from the centre of Cambridge, the office is located just of Mill Road, the cultural heart of Cambridge (and probably the closest thing you can get to a London street outside of the capital). We're surrounded by green spaces, pubs, shops and caf\u00e9s (including the legendary Hot Numbers). We've even got parking spaces. We operate a flexitime scheme too so those of you who are commuting from out of town don't have to spend four hours a day stuck in a traffic jam to and from work.> How to applyPlease send CV, covering note and links to any websites or applications you have created, or been involved with, to jobs@onespacemedia.com.

So, there is a lot of interesting work to be done.\n\n  - Modern HTML Applications: We\u2019re very excited about  JavaScript frameworks that\n              have grown in popularity (like Angular.js, D3). We\u2019re interested in\n              using web technologies for our mobile and desktop applications, so if\n              you\u2019re experienced with (or just interested in) JavaScript, \n              CoffeeScript, SCSS, WebSockets, or BOSH, there\u2019s a lot of research \n              and development to be done.\n\n  - Voice Technology: All calls using Ringio run through our voice systems to enable\n              things like on-hold music, call screening, and transfers.\n              We have a lot of new voice functionality that we\u2019d like to build,\n              as well as technology we\u2019d like to integrate. This is fairly unique to\n              our industry and involves some interesting timing, reliability,\n              concurrency, and state management problems.\n\n  - API Development: Integration with CRM systems and reselling partners requires APIs\n              for large pieces of our platform. We need help expanding our APIs, \n              making sure they\u2019re usable and secure, and testing that they\u2019re working\n              correctly.We\u2019re Looking For People Who Are:- Smart software developers\n\n  - Familiar with object oriented programming. We use Grails and Java for our major\n    systems but are moving towards Go, Node.js for our service layer. We don't require\n    you know any of these languages, but expertise in *a* language is desired.\n    If you are interested in Go or node.js you should definitely get in touch.\n\n  - Familiar with Unix/Linux command-line systems. Logging into a Linux server to count\n    the number of ERROR lines in a log file grouped by hour wouldn\u2019t be difficult\n    for you.\n\n  - Excited about joining a startup and wearing many hats.\n\n  - Authorized to work in the US\n\n  - Able to work from our Courthouse Metro office (flexibility to work from home\n    sometimes, but most time will be at the office)If you're interested, email srijak AT ringio.com[1].[1] Email should have your resume attached, have the string \"from hackernews\" somewhere in the subject line, and tell us why you think Ringio should hire you :)",

Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n  \n  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, 401(k) + match, \n    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with\n    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.A little bit about Grand Rapids:- 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, and less than an hour to the beach.\n  \n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in the\n    Beer Advocate top 15.

If you\u2019re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the \n    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought \n    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my \n    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n  \n  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of startups. \n    The energy here around the growth in technology and the support for entrepreneurs \n    is infectious.A little bit about you:- You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n  \n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n  \n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n  \n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.If you're interested, send me your resume/CV and a little bit about why you\u2019re interested:ej@mutuallyhuman.com",

                "Skype - Palo Alto, CA - Software Engineer\nFulltime, H1BWe are building large-scale elastic services to support the evolution of the Skype network.  The important part is that we have a lot of fun building and owning distributed systems and are looking for engineers who can come in and push their first feature to production within a few days of starting and who can also help us get that duration down to hours.  The stack is primarily azure/.net/C#, although there is some node.js in the house and when we do UIs we don't use biggish server-side stacks.  But when we do server-side systems we run them on 1000s of instances and support 10^5 req/sec all day, every day.The key is that we own our own systems and hence our destiny.

You could call this an intern type position, but I don't care if you are in school or not.Prgmr.com rents virtual private servers, dedicated servers, and datacenter space.  Right now, we have 3 full-time folks, counting me, and two part-timers but I'm the only hardware person, and only two of us are local.So, there are several catches.  the first?  I can't afford a full time person for at least two months.   If you are willing to show up and work between then and now?  $15/hr on a 1099.  After those two months (and after I'm done paying for twice the co-lo I need)  we can talk about going full time W2.  (prgmr.com pays for Kaiser, if you are full-time)Now, I do have an arrangement with a local refurbished server and network hardware dealer;  I give him a good entry level person, he'll hire them full time with health insurance and stuff (for a little more than I'm paying;  not a lot more, this is definitely still entry-level pay.)  and he'll rent you back to me on a per-day basis at a discount (sort of as a referral bonus to me.)   - so that's one way you can make this full-time before I stabilize prgmr.com.   Note, he's based out of mountain view, and I'm in Santa Clara and all of this is very much hands-on work.So yeah, what I need is someone I can teach how to handle my layer-1.   I need my shit wired up, I need it wired up neatly (I can train you in cable lacing, but the neater you are, the better.)   I need all my ports labeled inside my network gear (I can show you how to do this; Serial ain't rocket science.)  and inside my PDUs.This would be pretty good for someone studying up on their CCNA or something;  I probably have obsolete hardware I could give you for your lab, too.I need someone I can train up to set up my IPMI out of band access.  Again, I can train, it's not hard.    Again, experience using the command line helps a lot.I also need someone who can handle racking/stacking servers, dragging servers to the car and back.  You need to be able to safely lift 50lbs, (and more importantly, you need to ask for help when you /can't/ lift safely.  pester the security guys;  they will usually help, and if not, call me.)  and you need transportation that can handle 50lb servers.  (meh, if you have transportation, we can probably work something out with the hauling.  I've got an old van I loan people.)You need to be able to handle ssh, and ssh with public key authentication with minimal help from me.So, the way I usually do this is that people email me, we go back and forth a few times (I won't hire you if you can't communicate via email... sorry, just one of my things.)  then next time I need help I call you up.   You show up and work.  I pay you (check, but if you want we can drop by the bank and get it cashed for you same day... just when I pay cash the accountant gets mad at me)   If you do well and I need help again, i call you back;   At these rates, (and especially with this (lack of) stability) it's not fair to expect you to interview for free.So yeah.  Entry level.    If you seem teachable, I don't care if you are currently unemployed.I demand honesty, but not loyalty;  by that, I mean I'm realistic. I'm not going to be angry if you move on to a better paying job quickly.Especially at first, while we're just doing 'as needed' gigs?  I'm understanding about your schedule;  I don't demand you drop everything for me.  (Once you go full time, we'll have to talk more about this.   I do eventually want someone besides me to be hardware on-call, but I understand that needs to be worth your time, and this offer probably is probably not good enough to get you to let me drag your ass out of bed at 2am.)\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          loungin on May 1, 2013           \n             | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  It is refreshing to see posts like this that are willing to teach.

That, and ISPs/hosting companies have traditionally been good places for entry-level folk.  There is a strong culture or tradition of mentorship, or at least, of hiring likely looking folk and letting them run systems above their pay grade.  (and to be clear, this will be a lot of that, too;  I mean, I don't expect you to know this stuff off the bat, and I expect some questions, but I also expect a certain level of ability to, you know, look it up and figure it out.)Locally? I hear that he.net also hires new people and trains; they even have a semi-formal training program.  Some of it is public, too. Check out their IPv6 certification.[1]  - but from what I hear, they have a lot more of that sort of thing internally.   They took my last PFY;  I likely would have been able to keep her if I had extended a full-time offer sooner, as they didn't offer great money, but like I said, I've got two more months of being financially very uncomfortable.[1]http://ipv6.he.net/certification/\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                        \n          \n          notJim on May 2, 2013           \n             | parent | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  I really enjoy how this is written, and while I'm not your guy here, I'd love to have a job with someone who writes this job post.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                  \n          \n          bmelton on May 1, 2013           \n             | parent | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Also, if there are any would-be customers looking for hosting, I can personally vouch that dealing with lsc via support is exactly as pleasant as this job posting is, even if you're really not supposed to need support. o.O\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                  \n          \n          microcolonel on May 1, 2013           \n             | parent | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  How would you feel about employing a minor?\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          lsc on May 1, 2013           \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  a little bit afraid?

To reduce downtime, companies depend on a global supply chain of warehouses, delivery services, and manufacturers to supply the service parts to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world. Baxter Planning Systems is seeking outstanding Java Developers to optimize and automate every facet of this service parts supply chain.Baxter Planning Systems offers a unique environment combining the flexibility of a startup with the stability of an established company. Our developers are involved in the entire product lifecycle, from problem description to design and execution. 20 years of established business with numerous satisfied customers provides ongoing revenue that isolates us from the anxiety of funding cycles or the constant search for the next big deal.Working closely with on-staff domain experts, our developers have the opportunity to learn about the complexities of global supply chain management, and offer their own solutions to the challenges it presents. Challenges like planning optimal stocking levels for tens of thousands of parts distributed across thousands of locations worldwide, combined with complex interdependencies due to substitutability, regulatory issues, and the need to minimize both downtime and cost.The ideal candidate for Baxter is a smart developer who gets things done by applying technology, especially open source, to meet our goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The development and QA teams work closely with key stakeholders to formulate and manage development timelines that are both realistic and produce high-quality application features. You won't have to start from scratch either: we have a great infrastructure of automated unit/integration/regression/UI tests, automated builds, virtualized test environments, and a solid technology stack. But we recognize there's always room for improvement and welcome the experience and expertise you'd bring in improving our development practices, tools, and execution.Regretfully at this time we are unable to accommodate 3rd party placement agencies, H-1B sponsorships,  long-term telecommuting, or relocation.

In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has.

We have over 650,000 users and are on a $1.3m+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to pass a million users in 2013. We are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts.We need help on 2 areas right now:1. Android:    - Android is our second highest source of signups for Buffer, only\n      trailing behind Web which was our original platform.\n    - our users love the app, which has a 4.3 rating on Google Play.\n    - the app has 100k+ total downloads and 3k daily active users.\n    - we work with Google Play, Kindle and Blackberry stores.\n\n2. Full stack:    - we get 1,500-2,000 signups per day on the web\n    - we have 160,000 weekly active users for our Chrome extension\n    - 4,500 API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Instapaper\n    - we ship to production multiple times a day\n    - we have a data-driven process, with Einstein, our custom\n      built a/b testing framework\n    - ideally, experience in: PHP (Codeigniter)/Python, MongoDB,\n      Backbone.js Javascript, CSS, HTML\n\n\nWe're a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we're excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.If you're interested in coming on board, you will:    - work closely myself on Product and Sunil on technical\n      architecture\n    - ship to thousands of users and iterate quickly\n    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes\n    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers\n      on issues and features\n    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great\n      approach in dealing with others\n    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, it\u2019s cool if not)\n    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and\n      support from us to move to where you want to be\n    - have experience working with another startup before (would\n      be awesome, it\u2019s cool if not)\n\nSome aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:    - we are totally transparent. We raised $450k, we currently\n      have 650k users and generate $110k/mo. Ask me anything else!\n    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we\n      have a formula for the distribution.\n    - we're all very focused on self improvement - we have daily\n      standups where we discuss our current improvements. This\n      could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging,\n      exercise, learning a language, etc.\n    - culture deck: http://www.slideshare.net/joelg2/buffer-culture-01-16707113\n\nSalary: 88k-110k depending on location (living costs) and experience.Equity: 0.5-1%If this sounds fun, let's chat.

It doesn't make much sense to me why a developer in a low cost of living area is worth less in terms of what features they develop for the company.  I say this as someone who lives in a high cost of living area, so I'd be at the higher end of your scale and this is not a self serving comment.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          icodestuff on May 2, 2013           \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  If the best developer for the job happens to be in Manhattan or SF, s/he won't take a job paying Detroit or Wichita salaries.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          epicureanideal on May 2, 2013           \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Right, but if they don't produce more than the \"normal Wichita salary\" then you probably shouldn't hire them.  If they produce enough value to be worth $150,000 per year let's say, then you pay them that.  If they don't, you shouldn't pay them that much whether they live in SF or Detroit.If they do produce enough to be worth $150,000, why pay them less just because they live in Wichita?  Supply and demand, sure, but it just seems odd to me to explicitly say that you're paying less if someone lives outside of a major metropolitan area.  I prefer to be (or think that I am) paid based on the value I produce (value pricing) rather than what it costs to keep a roof over my head (cost pricing).  Whether or not this is the case also influences my understanding of how a company thinks about me.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                        \n          \n          kroy on May 2, 2013           \n             | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  A lower salary for a developer in low CoL area doesn't indicate that a company values that resource less than another dev in a higher CoL area.  It just means that the company has to pay less in order to reward the developer in the low CoL as much as the employer rewards the high CoL dev.  The equation looks like this:salary - CoL/year = reward_dev\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          epicureanideal on May 2, 2013           \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Sure, but I still find it interesting to make the following observation:The CoL modification to the developer's salary has nothing to do with whether the company makes more or less revenue as a result of their work.My guess is that as companies find good talent increasingly hard to find this problem will resolve itself as the remote workers outside major metropolitan areas get bidded to higher and higher salaries.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                              \n          \n          HorizonXP on May 1, 2013           \n             | parent | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Honestly, I'd love to write a native BlackBerry 10 app for you guys, if I were given the chance on a part-time/consulting basis.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                  \n          \n          dirktheman on May 3, 2013           \n             | parent | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  You must be one of the power users of CodeIgniter!

If you are interested in creating great products, building new features and improving the existing Shopify features, then please apply!Developing ShopifyShopify is the longest continuously developed Rails app on the planet and we care a great deal about code quality. Shopify, in contrast to most other rails shops, always runs on the latest rails version. Many core rails features have been developed within Shopify and have later been added to the Rails framework. We often go back and improve core parts of the Shopify codebase to make it better or more lean. We can do this because we have a positively massive unit test coverage which will immediately sound the alarm when something goes wrong.We ship on quality instead of on time. When a feature is ready we deploy it immediately to everyone or use an internal system to roll it out to a certain percentage of customers. Various teams deploy new code many times throughout the day.Shopify's production scale is massive. We host tens of thousands of online stores and regularly see hundreds of millions of requests a day. When you push out new code tons of people will see what you made within seconds. Operating on this level is hard but incredibly rewarding.Responsibilities:* Write back-end code in Ruby and Go.* Work with a world class design and product team.* Providing beautiful and fast code that improves the code-base of our products in meaningful ways.* Use TDD to write rock-solid code, utilizing our huge test suite to make changes with confidence.* Rapidly fix bugs or take your time to solve hard problems well.* Deploy code to hundreds of servers and tens of thousands of customers in your first week.* Never stop learning. Shopify is an environment of constant personal growth.Qualifications and Desired Skills:* Know Rails or be ready to learn it quickly.* Proficiency with UNIX commands.* Knowledge of relational databases and SQL, we use MySQL.* Strong commitment to quality.* Experience building and scaling user-focused web application.* Being awesome and having a love for Shopify - Major Plus!\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          psycr on May 1, 2013           \n             | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  What does Shopify use Go for?

You think the famous quote, \"there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things\" is spot on.  Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved.  You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users.  You've built complex, popular web-based applications before.  You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css.  Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required.  Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.2) Head of Marketing &#38; Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker.  When you throw a party, too many people show up.  You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign.  Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you.  You believe product design and marketing are one and the same.  You're ready to join an extremely talented product &#38; engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we're working on sounds intriguing, then we'd love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

Companies like Google and Facebook are developing very fancy algorithms and pushing the state of the art to bring amazing insights into... which cat video you should click on next? Incredible smarts are being applied for seemingly trivial things in the consumer space, while in the enterprise space, decision-making is still mostly gut-driven, at most supplemented by a few Excel charts. This shouldn't be.

Interested in being part of a friendly, dynamic team in a central Cambridge studio? We want to talk to front or back end developers who are creative, organised and love all things web. Ideally you'll have some or all of the following skills:Knowledge of writing standards-compliant, high-performing HTML5 and CSS web pages.\nExperience of working with popular web libraries.\nWe use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job.\nGood knowledge of at least one programming language.\nWe work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too.\nAn understanding of database programming and design. Familiarity with *nix based operating systems.\nAwareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.\nMore important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).What you can expect to work onExpect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.How we workAs a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.LearningThe web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.LifestyleWorking at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles. Just ten minutes walk from the station and ten minutes walk from the centre of Cambridge, the office is located just of Mill Road, the cultural heart of Cambridge (and probably the closest thing you can get to a London street outside of the capital). We're surrounded by green spaces, pubs, shops and caf\u00e9s (including the legendary Hot Numbers). We've even got parking spaces. We operate a flexitime scheme too so those of you who are commuting from out of town don't have to spend four hours a day stuck in a traffic jam to and from work.How to applyPlease send CV, covering note and links to any websites or applications you have created, or been involved with, to jobs@onespacemedia.com.

We\u2019ve proven the model, with over $60MM in orders and over $150k per month in transactions. We\u2019re just getting started, and we need your help to scale.Our culture is driven by a simple constraint: every colleague we add should make the rest of the team happier and better at their own jobs.

Help us continue to push watching both pro and personal video gaming main stream. We've hit on a strong product market fit and we're growing hand over fist right now. As such we have need for:- backend engineers[1]- product engineers[2]We're analytical about the work that we do and you should be too. You should also care about getting things done right, and be pragmatic about when to choose speed over quality, if you opt for the former you're the type of engineer that makes a note that you shorted on quality and you'll come back and fix that up.We keep small engineering teams (usually no more than 10 people per team), this permits us to own what we work on. It is one of the best things about working here in my experience!The low down on the positions:[1] - Backend EngineersWith 30m MAU (last published number... it is bigger now!) our backend engineers work to keep our service humming along with five nines of uptime. Your work would include not only improving core pieces of infrastructure but also envisaging new pieces that we do not have yet that will help take us to the next level. Some examples of things that have been done recently:- migration to ruby 1.9- built out a new IRC chat server which handles ~1000 qps. Best thing here is we slotted this in and no one noticed (except that chat was more stable, etc).- Created a brand new API to access our data, this is used by Activision (Call of Duty: Black Ops II), EA (EA origin) and PlanetSide II, Smite, amongst a wide array of other game devs.- Replaced a core piece of infrastructure used to let us know what streams are live, and what content they have on them. Again, this has been done without anyone noticing - its main win was taking us from needing 8 app servers to being able to handle all the load on one, but we run a couple of resilience.. naturallyWe've a bunch of other coolness in the pipeline.[2] - Product EngineersOne of the reasons we're growing so fast is that we're starting to churn out high quality features and general product improvements. There is still so far to go, the twitch you see now is as a result of dedicating much of our engineering work to scaling, in that time we've hired some kick ass product engineers and they're starting to push us forwards.  Some things we've worked on recently:- migrating site over to emberjs- \"Turbo\" - ad free watching on all channels- key product improvements: vod watching, vod creation- new flash player - faster, less resource intensive, easier to build new features on- payment provider integrations - aiming to make it as easy to pay in various geos as is possible.We've a bunch of other coolness in the pipeline!

Currently we have a few PhD's, few ex-googler's, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( http://www.testng.org ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( http://mailinator.blogspot.com ). And we're only up to 7 people. But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.Job Description: Someone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.Our technology includes: Java. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)Job Requirements: You know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold. You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there. You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.The interview:We love solving problems and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code. So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun. Right answers aren't the point - finding a good attack vector on the problem is.Our CTO's take on getting your resume Silicon Valley ready: \nhttp://paultyma.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-get-your-resume-...\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                  \n          \n          theflyingkiwi42 on May 1, 2013           \n             | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Simply Studio / 17 Hats (http://simplystudio.com/) - IRVINE, CA / REMOTE (US/CANADA preferred)We're looking for a senior web developer to join our team.

You start by looking the status of the production dashboard and bugs. With a quick scan you find that that the message counts are not getting updated in the dashboard after the code push last night. You jump on it right way and send a short code-review out, after testing it on your staging setup.With that out of the way, you get back to the feature that you have been working on. You know exactly why you are building this feature and what impact it will have on the customers. The feature was specced out last week in some intense design discussions. You finished a quick prototype yesterday. You throw it out today and start the code and unit testing for the initial release. The plan is to deploy a basic version this week sometime, gather feedback over a few days and then fine-tune it based on what the customers say.Just after lunch, while you code, you come across a bug in the queuing sub-system. You decide that it would be simple for you to fix it as well and so you do. While you fixed the bug, you thought about how you can make the queuing system much more scalable. You write a quick note to yourself to talk about it later.By the end of the day you'll have a good chunk of the new feature implemented. You'll send that queuing system bug fix for code-review tomorrow morning and continue your work of the new feature.\nHow the role will developInitially, the tasks you take on will be smaller and fairly well defined. Longer term, the requirements you get will be more general, and you\u2019ll interpret them to produce great solutions. You\u2019ll also generate tasks on your own initiative as you identify opportunities.As we grow, we may need to take on more developers.

Work permit and relocation assistance provided.Hiring for two different companies, both of whom will pay your relocation.Company 1:Looking for UX designers, front-end and back-end developers.\nUX designer: use Photoshop, Gimp, or whatever makes your socks roll up and down and you know how to make Web and/or mobile applications work for customers. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS also needed.Front-end developer: you can make Web sites do exactly what you want them to do, regardless of the browser or operating system the web site is running on. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required.Back-end developers: you know what it takes to power the back-end of large web sites. You understand scalability issues and can explain the difference between an inner and outer join. You know what O(log N) is and why it's important. Your programming language history isn't important because you're good enough to learn a new language if needed.All positions: not looking for rock stars. Looking for competent technical talent who are willing to move to Europe (unless you're already here). We have many expats working here and we'll even help pay for Dutch lessons, if you want them.We also like people who understand business because you'll be expected to make many of your own decisions without having to ask permission from management for every little thing that you do. You will have the power to get stuff done, work with a great bunch of people and be able to spend your five weeks of vacation time cruising across Europe and discovering why Amsterdam is such a beautiful city.Company 2:Unlike Company 1, Company 2 is looking for rock stars to bring to Amsterdam. They want front-end devs and system engineers. They want you to have at least a bachelor's degree in IT or a related field and you have to have a fairly impressive resume/CV (in terms of work, open source or educational background (preferably all three)) to even get an interview. In return, they offer a very agile environment, hard tasks, in a stable, long-term company. Large company, but each team gets a room with only a few people (no open-plan distractions). Management gets out of your way and meetings are discouraged. There's a heavy focus on constant performance optimization of systems because no one like a slow system. Multiple programming languages are used with the language being chosen to fit the problem and not the other way around.Front-end devs: mostly PHP with Smarty and Propel, though other languages, such as Java,  and Python are used. You will be working on desktop, tablet and mobile applications and know Javascript and CSS fluently. This means more than just jQuery! Mobile experience is helpful, as it UX work.System Engineers: you will be responsible for thousands of Linux servers across several data centers. Company 2 serves a quarter of a billion page views a day and heavy use of the latest open-source technologies is encouraged in their quest for better and better performance. Nginx, Puppet, stackless Python and MySQL are just a few of the technologies involved. The engineers are heavily involved in open source and are encouraged to give back to the community. You have deep experience in Linux, preferably multiple distributions, you know bash and at least one scripting language. You have strong experience with a variety of open source monitoring and scalability technologies.To apply for any of these, send an email to jobs at allaroundtheworld.fr and refer to this post.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          zukhan on May 1, 2013           \n             | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Just a tip, you'd probably get more traction if you mentioned names of the companies and what they actually do.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                      \n          \n          Ovid on May 2, 2013           \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  You're right, but there's a catch-22: my wife and I are starting a company focusing on helping people move to other countries.

We have roughly 4,000 R&#38;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level \"app\" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R&#38;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion \"ticks\" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one \"feed\") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)We could use a motto like \"We do a lot of stuff.\"Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com.

We have over 40 million monthly users, but only 5 engineers.  That's 8 million users per engineer!==Our vision==\nImagine a world where anyone can easily learn how to do anything. A world where access to comprehensive step-by-step instructions in multiple languages enables billions of people to improve their lives, in both ordinary and extraordinary ways. That\u2019s the world we want to create.==Where==\nwikiHow is located in a homey office in downtown Palo Alto, California, three blocks from the Palo Alto Caltrain Station. We also have satellite offices in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington.==Why we\u2019re different==\n* We take wikiHow's educational mission seriously. We put our mission above short-term business goals.\n* We pay well. You get the joys of a nonprofit mission with a competitive for-profit salary and benefits package. \n* We have a huge number of users, but a very small team. Your work will make an immediate, noticeable impact on millions of people. \n* We all work from home one day a week.\n* We don't think working long startup hours is productive or healthy. We work hard and productively, then go enjoy rich lives outside of work. \n* Our small, cohesive team is gender balanced: 50% female, 50% male.\n* We\u2019re often wrong (and that\u2019s OK).  Making mistakes shows that we are innovating. We love to innovate.   \n* We like walking. We even have a few treadmill desks.\n* We love coming to work every day. Working with intelligent people to accomplish something globally ambitious is intrinsically satisfying. \n* We like to share. We develop open source software and Creative Commons licensed content.  \n* With over 40 million readers a month, wikiHow is one of the top 200 sites on the web. Even your mom will use and love our product.\n* We are profitable and growing. \n* We are self-funded. We refuse VC money on a regular basis. Investors don\u2019t make our decisions, we do. \n* We are better in person than on TV:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI\n* We're delightfully quirky (but you probably figured that out already).=== A warning ===\nBefore you book an appointment with us, you should understand that wikiHow is not hoping to be acquired or looking for a quick financial exit. Our company is already profitable, financially stable (aka your job isn\u2019t going away at someone\u2019s whim), and we all love working here, so we aren\u2019t in a rush to sell it to some big company. In fact, we think we are doing a pretty good job running it, and selling it might mean the end to a product that we all love working on. The team here shares a passion for helping the millions of people we reach everyday. It is an amazing feeling to work on such a popular and impactful product! That amazing feeling makes us smile when we wake up every day and think about going to work. If all of this sounds appealing to you, we encourage you to apply... If this is a bummer, then that\u2019s okay too, we probably aren\u2019t the best fit for you right now...and that\u2019s totally fine!===Engineering at wikiHow===\nWe have a five-person engineering team and over 40 million users.  That\u2019s more than 8 million users per engineer!  Everything you build will make an immediate impact on millions of people.Some of the problems wikiHow engineers are working on:\n* Building user-facing features for our volunteer editing community that are fun enough to gather mass usage, while simultaneously making sure the output of the work produces high-quality educational information. It\u2019s easy to get people to upload funny cat memes on the Web; the real challenge comes when you want them to create and curate the world\u2019s best instructional content. \n* Creating features to bring in new content contributors. To keep growing and achieve our goals, we solve how to enable contributors from mobile devices, as well as continuing to gain new desktop community members.\n* Scaling, scaling, scaling.  We get more users before 10 AM than most startups will get in their entire existence. \n* Big data. Lots of usage creates lots of data that we work with to further improve our products.\n* Mobile and tablets. The majority of wikiHow users will soon be on portable devices, but they don\u2019t practice typical behavior patterns.  We are rethinking wikis and collaboratively created content for the mobile era. \n* Reader delight features. Better software means happier readers. We\u2019re inventing new ways to make learning pleasant and more efficient.\n* Your awesome idea! We value our employees ideas and opinions, and most of our projects originate from people on the team.Our stack:\nPHP, Mediawiki, MySQL, Bash, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, C++, Memcache, Varnish, Nginx, Linux, iOS, Android. This is a partial list, because we also explore and test new technologies.We\u2019re looking for full-stack engineers, and are hiring people with a variety of experience levels and technology interests.Apply at engineering-jobs@wikihow.com\nhttp://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Jobs\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                            \n          \n          ryansapper on May 1, 2013           \n             | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Causes.com - San Francisco - Relocation Available - FTCauses.com is looking for great software engineers to join our growing eng team (currently 20). Design, build and deliver innovative tools that inspire people to create social change from their corner of the world. You\u2019ll give people the ability to support their beliefs, clean up political corruption and provide real-time relief to those in need. Engineers at Causes tend to be jack-of-all-trades, though we love people who have mastered a specific part of the stack, from front-end to back-end and all the data in between. We believe that the only way to create change is for people to work together; it's the principle that guides how we run our company. From deep-dive product debates to catered lunch chats, every great idea gets its day at Causes. We encourage each other's interests just as much as we foster professional growth, and here those two tend to be one and the same.We are currently hiring for software engineers and one iOS engineer. Read more about the positions at (http://causes.com/jobs)Below are some common questions we get from engineers who are interested, and one of our awesome engineers has decided to answer them:Q: What is your team environment like? \nA: The team environment is extremely open and loose. Our engineering team has a flat structure - one of our explicit goals is to create a space where we are all on equal footing to create opportunities to teach ourselves and learn from each other. We encourage everyone to be constantly questioning and evaluating our development processes so that we can keep getting better over time. Every engineer has a tremendous amount of power in terms of identifying what the most impactful things to be working on are, and to take on those challenges with the support of the team.Q: Are you a pretty casual startup or more corporate styled? \nA: We have a couple key meetings each week. Each morning we have a standup that we expect the whole team to be present for; having the team start the day together is important to us. We finish each week with a retrospective where we gather around a whiteboard, have some drinks, and consider the process for the week. Taking time each week to reflect on what went well and how we can replicate success, as well as what didn't and how we can avoid similar mistakes in the future makes this feel like one of the healthiest teams I have ever been a part of.Q: Do you guys pair program? \nA: We definitely encourage pairing - I probably spend about a quarter of my time coding with a partner, and I'm trying to find ways to do even more. We used to have pairing stations set up explicitly for this (two keyboards, two mice, four monitors), but as our team has gotten more comfortable with other solutions like screen sharing via tmux the pairing stations have gently fallen into disuse. I would love to hear what setups you have found to be successful in encouraging good pairing sessions. We're always looking to find more ways to effectively collaborate!Q: What is the developer life like?\nA: In my opinion, the developer life at Causes is pretty spectacular. I get to work with some of the most awesome people I know, both technically and in a wide variety of other talents and interests. Jimmy, who leads our engineering team, used to be a performing stage magician. Rocky works with our Impact team and has represented the US in Ultimate Frisbee tournaments. There is a level of passion in my coworkers that I've never seen anywhere else, and I get to spend my time working, eating, talking, and playing with these people. As a developer, I get to work with fantastic technology. We are constantly upgrading our stack, and I often get to learn about things that are new to me. Most of our devs spend the day ssh'd into a workstation editing code in Vim, although we have one dev who tunnels the filesystem so that he can work in RubyMine, and at different times we have had folks working in TextMate, Sublime, Emacs, and Eclipse. All of our code goes through a code review tool called Gerrit that we use both to prevent software defects and as a way to teach each other about our craft. Gerrit is integrated with our Jenkins CI so that every patch has the complete test suite run against it before being merged.We work in small development teams that generally include four developers, a product manager, and a designer. These teams give engineering access to the product design process that I haven't seen at the other companies I have been at. There's a neat sense of satisfaction when you are pairing with a designer to tweak a page into perfection. Working directly with the product team means that we get a lot of insight into what is coming down the pipe, and can often contribute to the direction of the product.------------Have you seen enough and you're now interested in joining the team?

Full time.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day.\nWe're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at http://academia.edu/hiring.

The position will work with an experienced group of software engineers to develop software supporting the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large scale genomic research projects.The Genome Institute has been at the forefront of genome research since its inception in 1993 and has been a part of major scientific projects such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects. The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease). In addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various educational and outreach efforts.Job QualificationsThe ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production environment. The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers across groups. The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get things done will find a lot of opportunity.Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the work. Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require thorough knowledge of each concept. The applicant will use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people and/or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians.Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful. Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset. Regular work will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or college plus two years of relevant work experience required. Additional relevant programming experience may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for required education.You can also send questions and resumes directly to me.\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                  \n          \n          timv on May 2, 2013           \n             | prev | next [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  Sydney (Darlinghurst), AustraliaSiteTour is looking for a full-time developer to join our team.We're a small startup - currently it's 2 full-timers (1 business, 1 tech [me]) plus some freelancers, advisors and partners. We're building a platform for the out-of-home advertising industry (billboards, bus shelters, buses, shopping centre panels, etc)Our current tech stack is Java (GWT/Spring/Hibernate), Geoserver, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), MySQL; but it's not set in stone.It's a full stack analysis+development role, taking changes from requirement through to testing, from front-end through to the database, and also assist in providing operational support for the live site.We have lots of opportunities that we're working through, and things are pretty fast-paced, so we need someone who is happy to receive requirements that are very loosely defined, flesh them out, produce a design (either in your head, or on paper depending on the size of the work) and then see it through development and testing.We're based in Darlinghurst (Sydney, Australia) and we're looking for someone who can be physically present in the office, but there's plenty of flexibility (we're happy to have a mix of work in the office/work from home). Sorry, we're not set up to sponsor overseas applicants at this time.The things we care about (in rough order)- Good cultural fit. It's a small team so we'll be seeing a lot of each other, and we want that to be something we're all happy about- A team player who can work with minimal supervision. We're busy and everyone's got a lot on their plate, so we want to be able to help each other out, but we also need everyone to be able to pick up their own work and run with it.- Happy to work full stack &#38; full life-cycle. One day might be spent brainstorming how we want some end-user features to work, and the next day spent neck deep in code. If you like that sort of variety, that's a good thing.- Happy to work with our technology stack, and able to productive quickly. I don't care too much whether you have GWT or AWS experience, as long as you're happy to work with it, and happy to put the effort in to get up to speed fast. Obviously if having experience makes those things easier.In return we can offer- Flexible work arrangements. Both of us (the 2 full-timers)  have young kids, so if you're in a similar situation we're happy to talk about how we can accommodate.- A chance to do Java development in Sydney without working for a bank/telco/consultancy. Those who work in Sydney will know that there's only a handful of interesting companies, and the rest is big corporate dev work (I know, I've done lots of it). If you've got a Java skillset but want to break out of that world, then here's an opportunity.- A fun office environment. We share office space with a couple of like-minded companies, and I think it's a fun place - hopefully you will too.Feel free to ask questions here, or email meUser: timDomain: sitetour.com.au\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n                  \n          \n          of on May 2, 2013           \n             | prev [\u2013]          \n                  \n                  TransformativeMed - Seattle\n(http://transformativemed.com/)We're looking for a full-time developer who wants to help make high-quality medical software that's being used in hospitals around the US.It would be great if you have experience with any of the following (but these aren't requirements):  * jQuery\n  * PHP\n  * PostgreSQL\n  * Unit testing (QUnit)\n\nOur office is in Seattle, WA - South Lake Union.Right now we're a small startup with around 5-6 employees.nik.nyby@transformativemed.com\n                      \n                  \n      \n        \n            \n  \n\n\nJoin us for AI Startup School this June 16-17 in San Francisco!\nGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | Contact\nSearch:       \n      \n  ",

Now do that for every page view and API call and in such a way that it can scale to thousands of clients. And this needs to be presented in a way the user understands in 25 different languages (including right-to-left), multiple currencies, multiple time zones and needs to look good on a variety of devices.As can be expected in a nascent billion dollar market there are many competitors, but unlike many other markets the usability and the quality of the algorithms make a big difference to business success.

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)There is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/(The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. Remote work is fine. We will handle re-location, including visas, if you would like to re-locate, but re-location is not necessary.If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu",

People who work here don\u2019t work more than 40 hour weeks. Seriously, we don\u2019t let them. We don\u2019t have a vacation policy. If you are the kind of person for whom we have to count vacation days, you\u2019re not the right person. Take care of your work, take time off and live your life. I have no idea how many days off any of our employees took last year. Because they get their work done and done well, I just don\u2019t care.You want to work here. I wear a t-shirt to work everyday. Mike wears a collar, but we make fun of him for it. I play ping pong every day because the title of \u201cKing of the Table\u201d is important. I care about our Office Mom\u2019s bird Ripley because she cares about it.You want to work here, because you\u2019re good.

Show us that you\u2019re good, and we\u2019ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you\u2019re going to do it. If you are uncomfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself, you probably don\u2019t want to work here.You want to work here, because we're good.

We won\u2019t forget that. We also didn\u2019t like working with people who couldn\u2019t keep up.We want depth of development skill, but particular languages are not crucial. Depth in Java or .NET would be a good place to start and experience with the LAMP stack or Python might come in handy. We\u2019re not hung up on a particular amount of experience, but we are adamant about a particular level of skill.In this particular role, excellent communictation and a desire to work with people will be important (yes, real live people...but at least they're other developers). We are looking for somebody who can help our clients integrate our products, but also get down and dirty in coding those products.About Rustici SoftwareRustici Software creates products that simplify conforming with e-learning standards like SCORM and AICC.

We\u2019re pragmatic, but we don\u2019t let that interfere with our perfectionism. We\u2019re fluent in computing concepts from anonymous memory management to monadic zeros.We\u2019re building a platform. Engineering innovation is our competitive advantage. We\u2019re doing something new and different in an industry that hasn\u2019t seen any real innovation in the last century. That excites us.We try to be technology agnostic, preferring suitability to ideology. Our services are small and chatty, communicating through well-defined interfaces. Sometimes we compose them in ways that are surprising even to us. We think that\u2019s healthy for a platform company. In general, we believe that sound system architecture and design are more important than any particular technology.Day to day we use Node.js, Cassandra, Jenkins, Go, Java, Puppet, and GitHub. We like continuous integration. In fact, we like most forms of process automation. Sometimes our tools make us happy, sometimes they make us sad. When they make us sad, we make them better.We like to work. We love to play. We don\u2019t consider these activities mutually exclusive.There aren\u2019t many of us. We\u2019re looking for more.About YouYou\u2019re an engineering powerhouse who wants to work on challenging problems with a group of equally amazing colleagues. Your depth of knowledge in many areas of computing should qualify you as a specialist, but your breadth of expertise demands that you describe yourself as a generalist. Sometimes you think the two aren\u2019t so different, but you resist that sort of reductionism.You\u2019re well rounded. You have hobbies that don\u2019t involve computers. Despite your expertise, you sometimes surprise casual acquaintances with your profession. You can\u2019t carry a tune but you sing anyways.

For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.

We use thermal cameras to map energy leaks at city scales to help our customers make smart decisions about their energy use.Our first product, launching in the next month, is a home energy report that will allow home owners to literally see the heat leaking from their homes, allowing them make informed decisions about possible improvements.Here's our big idea: In the coming years, we want to create a nationwide energy market to allow us to identify properties that would benefit the most from an energy efficiency upgrade.We would offer free home improvements to homeowners. In return, the homeowner agrees to a fixed energy bill for some period of time. The homeowner, instead of paying the utilities directly, would pay us and in return would receive a lower, predictable monthly energy bill.Our mission is to build and drive this market. We're excited about using technology to help the environment and help people live more comfortable, less-impactful lives.That's our idea\u2026 but we need your help make it a reality.Come talk to us! Email phil@essess.com for more details.And, for those interested, here's an example image:http://imgur.com/tmWRh5Y",

                "Buffer (http://bufferapp.com) - Anywhere in the world (we're a distributed team of 10 people in the US, UK, Hong Kong and Sydney).I'd love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We have over 500,000 users and are on a $1M+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to hit the millions of users in 2013.We've consistently grown 15% MoM for the last year and are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts. That's where we are in need of some help.So, we're looking for an Android Developer to work on our app.\n    This includes taking over most of the work of the app which has\n    70,000 downloads and more in the Kindle and Blackberry stores too.\n    If you've worked with Android before, that's great. If you're a great\n    hacker and have developed in Java or other mobile platforms that's\n    awesome also.If you're interested in coming on board, you will:- work primarily with myself and Sunil, who has lead development\n      so far and is now taking a more general tech role\n    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great\n      approach in dealing with others\n    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, it\u2019s cool if not)\n    - be friendly and comfortable helping our users\n    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and\n      support from us to move to where you want to be\n    - have experience working with another startup before (would\n      be awesome, it\u2019s cool if not)One of our core values at Buffer is to \"Default to transparency\". I've told you above how many users we have, and our revenues. We raised $450k from awesome investors, and we are cash-flow positive. Within the team, there is even more transparency. We have an Open Salary policy where everyone knows how much everyone else makes.Another key value we have is to \"Have a focus on self improvement\". The thing that we do which I don't know that any other startups do, is that we have a daily 'standup' Google Hangout between pairs of people in the team (the pairs cycle each 2 weeks). As part of the call we share a daily improvement. Something we're working on to improve ourselves. It can be related to Buffer, but usually it isn't. Some examples of improvements people have worked on: start blogging every 2 weeks, speak at first event, speak to a new person every day, wake up an hour earlier. We all encourage each other with our improvements, and this helps us push forward much faster than otherwise. It's a really positive environment and there is built in accountability. Everyone here seems to progress at an incredible pace, we want to do everything to make that happen for you as well. Whether you want to start speaking, blogging, learning marketing or have other areas of personal growth, you\u2019ll have my personal support and the whole team as a resource too.If you're interested in all our values, you can take a look at them here:http://www.slideshare.net/joelg2/buffer-culture-01-16707113Since we have Open Salaries at Buffer, I can tell you right now that your salary will be between $88k and $110k depending on your location (living costs) and experience.

                "SF - full-time, Front End EngineerAbout Statwing:We love analyzing data. We love the feeling of getting an idea, exploring some hypotheses, and finding a surprising story in the data. And we love enabling others to have that feeling. That\u2019s why we\u2019re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and much faster.Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but they\u2019re so dressed up in the arcane language of t-tests and p-values that they\u2019re off limits to most humans, and painfully time-consuming for experts. Most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface that\u2019s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.We\u2019re two Stanford alums and we work in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, near the 16th and Mission BART stop. Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term \"Data Science\", built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).About the job:Radically improving the UI for data analysis is the core challenge of our company. As our first hire and only front-end specialist, you'll drive the function and feel of our UI, creating entirely new ways of interacting with data. You\u2019ll meet weekly with the designer of the TiVo UI (an advisor of ours) to sketch out solutions to extremely challenging usability problems, which you'll then implement. You'll code in HTML, CSS/LESS, Ruby, and Coffeescript, using Bootstrap, Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, and d3. And as the first hire, you\u2019ll earn significant equity and help shape our culture.The ideal candidate:Excited about taking responsibility and ownership over big pieces of the product. Comfortable with UI and UX challenges. Graphic design skills are a bonus (we currently have none).. Interested in data analysis.. An extremely talented programmer, skilled with front end tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Coffeescript.. Familiarity with the other tools listed above is a bonus.\nDeeply concerned with system reliability, code quality, and front end architecture..

Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US - but our office culture is so great that you might really want to be here beside us!Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We were recently named one of \"50 Disruptive Companies in 2013\" by MIT Technology Review (http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr50/2013/).  We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure (http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure), machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.You can email me personally at jake@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:Palo Alto Software Engineer:http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Software engineer:http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn&s=HackernewsLos Angeles Data Engineer:http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq&s=Hackernews",

                "MokaFive - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns and H1Bs welcome, although it's somewhat late in the summer-internship cycle.MokaFive makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS (and other platforms) to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)See mokafive.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!",

Our first salesperson could easily wind up VP of Sales or Chief Marketing Officer or something down the road (if they are interested, of course).We're also open to adding another technical person to the co-founding team.

A double extra super bonus would be any experience or background as a business analyst or similar role.  Front end development skills would be a positive as well, but isn't required (one of the current co-founders (not me) is a bad-ass front-end designer).So, if you're interested in joining the next great Open Source enterprise software company, working on Open Source projects full-time (and we mean REAL Open Source, developed in the open, collaboratively, ASLv2 licensed, etc), working on hard problems with Machine Learning, NLP, Information Retrieval, Social Network Analysis, and \"big data\" tools, get in touch.

We're early-stage, pseudo-stealth, but with great momentum and access to the market, and we're well funded.

Our jobs:Dev/ops: our backend systems and infrastructure are all written in Go (it\u2019s awesome). We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL and other storage technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment. We're looking for someone who can switch in and out of a couple of developer and sysops roles -- writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Chef recipes, and so on. We're a small team, so the real job description is \"we need another backend/infrastructure engineer.\"Frontend: the web app is backed by PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by a lot of JavaScript, using up-to-date technologies and frameworks. There's a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex user interface that's key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP and the stuff that runs in the browser, and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too. If you've got the latter skillset, then the PHP coding is optional.Head of UX/UI: your impact would be immediate as we already have leading consumer web companies using our technology. Your impact would also be lasting because there really isn\u2019t anything in this space, and, if you can lead the defining efforts of UX/UI for system administration, then you will have moved the industry forward. \nIdeally, you know Photoshop, have worked with front-end development teams and know a little bit about system administration. Additionally, we work with a lot of charts and graphs, and notification feeds. Other than that, we are open to a variety of experiences.As an early-stage company, we offer the chance to end up owning a fair chunk of what we believe is likely to be a very valuable business.Email jobs@vividcortex.com",

                "MokaFive - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns (specifically college students looking for summer internships) and H1Bs welcomeMokaFive makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)See mokafive.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!I'll be in Cambridge and Pittsburgh next week for the MIT and CMU career fairs, with time to chat with interested folks in those two cities.",

Now it's time for us to bring a real pro - we've figured out the product and the market segments, and now we need someone who can use what we've learned to close a whole bunch of new customers.When we talk to prospects, we hear things like \"We've been looking for a solution to this problem for the past three weeks.  This is EXACTLY what we were looking for\".  There are tons of leads just waiting for someone to give them a demo and close them, as well as a ton of companies that don't know they want to talk to us yet (we usually come back from conferences with handfuls of business cards to give demos to).As our first dedicated sales person, there's a huge opportunity waiting for you (and responsibility to match).  You'll set the tone for our whole sales organization, and have the opportunity to grow into a very senior management role.  You'll be instrumental in helping develop a repeatable, measurable sales process.  At the same time, you should be comfortable with being the feet on the street while we ramp up.  We have had great luck with attending conferences, sending cold emails, and giving web demos to close new customers.Our entire team works remotely.  We're very flexible about where and when you work, as long as you're hustling, closing deals, and keeping our existing customers happy and paying.  Being in somewhere in the bay area is a big bonus, as both founders are here, as are a lot of our customers.

We are looking to fill 3 positions:Front-End/UI Engineer - Must have a good attention to detail and be able to use and contribute to a large, modular Javascript codebase (built on dojo). Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.Software Engineer - With just 2.5 programmers right now (our CEO has a CS PhD but a lot of other responsibilities), we all wear many hats. Our server is written in Java 7 and runs on the latest Jetty. We use Hibernate and Spring with annotation-based configuration (minimal XML). We use Lucene for indexing documents, Cassandra for logging and searching user events, MySQL for storing relational data, and it all runs on AWS technologies. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data.

                "MokaFive - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns welcome, H1Bs probably welcome but I'm just an engineer so don't ask me.MokaFive makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)See mokafive.com for more info, or send me an email (gthomas at that domain name).",

This developer will start on a contract basis, remotely with a 2-3 month term, with the possibility of becoming full-time. We use github, gchat and email to communicate asynchronously, but we'll fly you out to our offices every once in a while if you're not already local.We run a very modern stack - nginx, gunicorn, puppet, celery, aws, redis & postgresql. Our web API (what you'll be working on), is tiny. It uses our own micro-framework (1148 lines of python) specifically for writing APIs built on werkzeug (from the flask family), sqlalchemy, 1161 lines of \u201cbusiness\u201d logic and 798 lines of tests. Much of the base functionality is complete (it\u2019s actively serving our mobile app), which means the next stage -- your primary responsibility -- is scaling this code and optimizing it all while continuing to strive for irreducible complexity.Day to day projects may include (but aren\u2019t limited to):* Implementing sharding logic in our python code* Porting our code to use gevent/eventlet* Profiling hot code areas and potentially rewriting them in C* Investigating whether PyPy makes senseIn addition - you may be \u201con-call\u201d to address server issues while you are actively working (read: sitting at a desk). If/when you transition to full-time these responsibilities may increase.Bubbli is building the technology and products to make bubbles. Bubbles are completely seamless spherical photos that you view through the window of a portable device. We think they're the most compelling means for communicating the real world on the flat web and millions of dollars of VC funding would seem to agree with us.

                "Mapquest.comPrimarily in Denver, CO and Lancaster, PA, but we're a relatively distributed company so go ahead and ask if you live somewhere else. As an AOL subsidiary, we've got employees who work out of AOL offices around the world so it wouldn't be unheard of to work from e.g. Seattle or New York if you decide Denver's just got too much sunshine. I've also been told we will sponsor an H1B.Over the past year, MapQuest has brought on an almost entirely new management team to shake things up and change the direction of the company from answering the ? \"How do I get there?\" to answering the more interesting ? \"Where do I want to go?\" We've released two new products in the last year (Discover and Local, formerly known as Vibe) and are aggressively working on creating an engineering-driven culture that actually builds things people might want to use instead of polishing products that were cool in 2004. We've had a banner year, and are looking to hire engineers as well as product managers to continue this upward trend.Among the technical roles we're looking to fill are several Ruby developers at varying levels of expertise to help develop new products as well as one Java developer to work with our data team and revamp various backend services (i.e. search, geocoding and a data ingestion service that populates our location databases). Ever since Valve leaked their company handbook, the phrase \"T shaped\" has been been thrown around a lot by upper management, so you'll need to be able to do full-stack development. We do a lot of pair programming right now, so if you've got experience doing that, it'd be a big plus. We're particularly interested in someone who's got very deep Rails experience to serve as a sort of tech lead, but we have many positions open for Rails people so if you'd be interested at all drop a line.Product is looking to bring on people with some combination of travel industry knowledge and mobile applications to help get the company past maps and directions. Most of our product people have development experience, so you'll be expected to be able to \"talk shop\" with the engineers you work with, but your day- to-day responsibilities aren't going to be producing code as much as producing ideas, pitching them to the rest of the company and helping the engineers and designers see them through to completion.I can definitively say that MapQuest is among the best places I've ever worked. The office space is fantastic (Downtown Denver right off the 16th Street Mall) and the new management team is very serious about doing things right as we try to pivot the company away from directions and into product development. The brand is practically a household name, the product team is happy to listen to engineers for feedback or ideas, and we've got the interesting position right now of being able to work like a startup except with a large pre-build audience (I've been told that we had 40M UV's on a brand new product on launch day, for example). You can read the company postings here (http://company.mapquest.com/careers/) but I'd really enjoy being able to answer ?'s directly. My e-mail is in my profile and please feel free to contact me personally if you have further ?'s, want to chat, or anything else. Happy 2013, and hope to hear from some of you soon!",
