In a 30-student math class, half of kids are ready to accelerate while half are still working on their foundational skills, but teachers cannot be in 30 places at once, giving each student one-on-one support.Until now. Imagine 30 teachers in every classroom\u2014that's how Goblins feels. Students draw math on any device, and our AI figures out the \"why\" behind their confusion, giving instant feedback and building conceptual foundations. (Preview:https://youtu.be/SH9UomzBMUs)Goblins launched to a private beta in March with 15 schools and 300 students. Since then we've built a waitlist of 2,300 teachers, and we now have paid school and district customers across the US and Mexico. We've also raised from angels and received a large grant from the Gates Foundation.We are in the unique position of having a product that is both highly differentiated and demanded. Anyone who joins now will be getting well-priced equity. By the end of this school year, this company will be much larger.Current technical problems we're working on:\u2192 Building knowledge graphs that adapt to student performance in real-time, routing them to the optimal next problem to work on\u2192 Extending our handwriting recognition from digital canvas to real paper through Chromebook cameras (think real-time OCR on math equations through low-quality webcams with poor lighting and limited CPU)\u2192 Creating interactive mathematical lessons (think 3blue1brown, but conversational) that remediate student misconceptionsYou'll be engineer #2 on the team, joining Sawyer (CEO, former Head of Design at X1, acquired by Robinhood, and math teacher) and Alp (CTO, previously Stripe and Amazon).We move fast, care deeply about craft, and obsess over delighting users.

We are building the google-maps of education - the only edtech where we bring a focused, standardized, digital approach to CS higher education. I speak about this on this podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1yEJbyEkQ).At the entry level, we only have final year internships (9-12 months) + PPO for students who are graduating in 2025. We index heavily on prior project/open source work for this role.Here's 3 cool things we've done:1. 100% AI based evaluators in B.Tech CS 4 year program.2. Measuring and improving each one of the 4000 hours of the program in the classroom.2. Launched our full-fledged program in 20+ universities in India, where students are placed from 3rd semester onwards. This year we've had more premium universities signup: SRM, VIT, Christ, etc.3. Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.To align you to our approach: we seek out engineers who want to involve with this problem statements. Edtech v1.0 in India does not have a good rep (tell me about it!), but the problem statements remains: higher education system is broken, and not giving students the outcomes they are capable of (Here's the outcomes we deliver -https://kalvium.com/hire-from-us/).Our main realization is: we can't rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students. That's what we've built and launched in above universities (https://kalvium.com/heros/). We have a 12 year roadmap! it's a blue ocean, and we want to build and lead Edtech V2.0.Note on team culture/equity: We plan on being a small core team that geeks out on learning and platform-izing it!

So we bought a year-long one, and tried to sublease it at cost (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36933603), so that way we could buy just one month.The goal of the company is the same: we want to make it possible to buy a big, giant training cluster for a short time period.

We are building the google-maps of education - the only edtech where we bring a focused, standardized, digital approach to CS higher education. I speak about this on this podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1yEJbyEkQ).Here's 3 cool things we've done:1. 100% AI based evaluators in B.Tech CS 4 year program.2. Launched our full-fledged program in 20+ universities in India, where students are placed from 3rd semester onwards. This year we've had more premium universities signup: SRM, VIT, Christ, etc.3. Solid business fundamentals - sustainability in every classroom with our revenue.To align you to our approach: we seek out engineers who want to involve with this problem statements. Edtech v1.0 in India does not have a good rep (tell me about it!), but the problem statements remains: higher education system is broken, and not giving students the outcomes they are capable of (Here's the outcomes we deliver -https://kalvium.com/hire-from-us/).Our main realization is: we can't rely on people to drive a significant change, rather it has to be a system which builds and uplifts skills in students.

                "Chorus One |https://chorus.one/careers| Platforms Engineer | REMOTE (Switzerland \u00b1 6 hours)Chorus One operates validators on many proof-of-stake blockchains (the ones where security is based on a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm rather than wasting energy). We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:* Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently).\n    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.\n    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it\u2019s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.\n    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what\u2019s going on.We do have a small cloud footprint but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud. (That sounds a bit pretentious and it\u2019s not exactly what we do, but it does involve many of the same aspects.)If this sounds interesting to you, check outhttps://careers.chorus.one/o/platforms-engineer-remote.\nAside from platforms engineers we are also hiring software engineers, seehttps://chorus.one/careers.",

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:* Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently).\n    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.\n    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it\u2019s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.\n    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what\u2019s going on.We do have a small cloud footprint but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud.

We have a vertically integrated app that serves as a one-stop shop for companies when it comes to asset maintenance, safety/compliance, crewing, dispatching, logistics, inventory, and much more.We've just begun to release new sets of features that focus on logistics for workboat companies that tow barges in the inland rivers of the USA (imagine 100k+ barges being pushed by towboats in rivers that carve through the American heartland, and all the major complexities that comes with tracking barges w/ cargo, optimizing schedules and tows, and generating invoices based off many movements and types of events).In addition, we've started to attract attention outside the maritime world, and we're excited about new opportunities to bring MobileOps to similar industries.[ Role ] \nWe're looking for a highly motivated individual with 5+ years of professional software engineering experience\u2014one who takes ownership of projects, has an eye for great UI/UX, and gets quality work completed on time (understanding, at a deep level, perfection v.s. shipping).

We offer benefits (health, vision, dental) and 401(k) matching.[ Stack ]\nMobileOps' BE is Ruby on Rails and the FE is almost 100% React components. While the frameworks are fairly standard, the problems we need to solve are quite out of the ordinary due to the nature of industry we serve, and there's a lot of challenging and unique problems to be solved outside of basic CRUD interfaces.If you\u2019re interested you can email: jobs@ company domain.

But, if you are interested in our stack, we use Svelte for the frontend, manage our own k8s cluster for both CPU-based containers or GPU ones, and use PostgreSQL for our database. we are still exploring different technologies regarding scaling such as horizontally scalable key-val stores. and, while we are not afraid of technology migrations or newer technology, we prefer to err on the side of speed while converging towards simplicity (e.g. hacking something together to put it in front of users and then slowly removing 3rd-party vendors of libraries once we have proven the product feature works).on applied researchers: we evaluate candidates based on their intuitions around the state-of-the-art in the use of AI for creative applications. this usually involves a few publications at top-conferences (ICML, CVPR, NeurIPS, ...), but it is technically not required since we think many of the best applied researchers are often self-taught and even found outside traditional research institutions.* Why now?We have been growing consistently in terms of recurring revenue, we have many world-class backers (e.g. founder of Facebook AI Research), and there is significantly more equity upside than elsewhere as of now -- especially since our current team is smaller than competitors. Our burn rate is exceptionally low, the amount of per-engineer impact is big (measured, for example, in millions-of-users / employee is probably among the top in our sector), and our financials are great.

There is a research component here as well though--figuring out how to train novel models and understanding exploits, working with PhDs and reading papers, and skilling up what \"red teaming\" this space even looks like. I'm on this team.#2: Platform Security. Figma uses AWS extensively and we've been working with other platform teams to harden this part of the stack. Some really smart people that I enjoy working with a lot and a portion of my time is spent on these problems too. (also includes hardening around employee laptops too)#3: Product Security. (AppSec + Anti-Abuse) Figma uses a lot of Ruby, but increasingly Golang too. I joined this team initially and can answer any questions. The major efforts are around trying to harden the stack to make things \"Secure by Default\" and also decreasing complexity in areas like permissions which has grown pretty wild.

We\u2019ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.\nHealthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That\u2019s not why they got into care.What\u2019s worse, these systems aren\u2019t hugely successful\u2014clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies\u2019 pockets.We\u2019re changing that.At Juniper, we\u2019ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic\u2019s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)Our typical paid rate is above 95%.We are a team of 25 with strong product market fit\u2014we\u2019ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can\u2019t build quickly enough.You\u2019ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.Interested in fixing American healthcare?

I\u2019ve helped us hire 8 of our amazing teammates, and \u2013 spoiler alert! \u2013 we\u2019re hiring for three more full stack software engineers.Why would you want to work at YC? Well, the short of it is that you\u2019d get unprecedented insight into how companies are started \u2013 with access to all the talks, constantly being around founders, and working directly with YC Group Partners. Our GPs are possibly the 12 most knowledgeable people in the world about starting companies. You\u2019d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day \u2013 which might be helpful if you\u2019re interested in starting a company yourself.Software also touches everything YC does. When I went through YC in 2013, the core pieces of the YC batch were a dinner each week, a 1-1 with your group partner, and an end-of-batch Demo Day event to raise money. Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:- Demo Day website, which has helped founders raise $3B+ over the last 3 years- Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers- Bookface, a tool for YC founders to support and help each other build their companiesYC software runs kind of like a startup: we have a small engineering team (12 people) full of full-stack software developers (Rails, React, Postgres) who talk to our users, ship fast and iterate often. YC\u2019s great for people who like to move fast and learn quickly. As a member of our team, you\u2019d work with and learn from some pretty experienced people who were early at Facebook, Carta, Salesforce, Twilio and other top companies. Many of us have also been founders, and seven former employees have gone on to start startups that were funded by YC.Building software at YC isn\u2019t for everyone \u2013 YC\u2019s real product is the Batch program and the Group Partners\u2019 advice and help for the life of your startup. Our software team is often in the background, helping scale YC\u2019s ability to help more companies, and in a way that meansmore1-1 attention and support for each founder. What keeps me motivated is continuing to scale and improve YC through software, and getting to work with some of the most kind and talented people of my 20+ year career.If you have questions, I would love to answer them here.

                "Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer\nIn the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that\u2019s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.Open positions include:* Engineering Manager, Data Platform* Sr Software Engineer, Full Stack - Provider* Senior Data Scientist, LLM* Lead Software Engineer, Rewards AI/ML* Lead Software Engineer, Data Platform* Lead Software Engineer, Program Engine* Lead Software Engineer, Developer InfrastructureJobs Board:https://bit.ly/nuna-job-boardFrontend: React, Typescript, Flutter (Android and iOS)Backend: Django, Python, Kotlin, ScalaCloud: AWSQuestions?

In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth's geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial \"global thermostat\" to keep Earth habitable \u2014 but it normally takes millenia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We're looking for founding full-stack engineers and data scientists to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the \"operating system\" for enhanced weathering at scale. There's a diverse set of challenges spanning interactive geospatial tooling, map and document digitization, laboratory sample management, logistical routing and optimization, and scientific modeling.Feel free to reach out to me at henry [at] lithoscarbon.com or check outhttps://careers.lithoscarbon.com/",

                "Procedural question: The REMOTE thing is not specific enough.I tentatively request suggestions (RFC) for a standard way of expressingremoteness:- remote in one country \n  - remote in region\n  - remote by exact timezone\n  - remote by timezone range (or official office hours)\n  - mostly remote, with some country qualification\n  - really, truly, totally remoteIn country,is because the company wants just one legal jurisdiction for employment, perhaps also for some filter on criminality/identity/banking.In regionis not really defined in the world, except EU has some common employment law, corporate/banking harmonization, and small timezone spread.Countries are not necessarily temporallycompactin the sense of only 1 timezone. Obviously Russia, Canada, US... are extreme examples. Chile is well-behaved. But some places are split on daylight savings, so that is not strictly included in the criterion, there is just +-1hr in summer/winter.Exact timezonemight allow various N-S combinations, such as London-Lisbon.Timezone rangemight allow London-Cape Town, or any US and Mexico. It's really overlapping office hours for core meeting schedule, independent of country.Mostly remotemight have some global freedom, but be limited to where the company has a legal entity for employment - or the opposite for contractors. Note that these may conflict: so you may not hire an 'offshore' contractor in a country where you have a legal presence (e.g. US company hires contractor through a Singapore company, but the contractor actually lives in Myanmar, which may be on the blacklist - see below, yes it is - or say India, where the original hiring company has a legal presence).Totally remotedoes not exist. There are legal and financial sanctions that exist from West-G7-G20-OECD against various other countries that are beyond-the-pale. The core subset of rejects are the obvious axis-of-evilly kinda places, but there are many excluded by a corrupt banking system, or cyberattack risk (assuming you ship laptop or have connectivity through local country ISP - surely not, that's what VPNs are for, but try asking to live in China :) For example, N. Korea is obviously off-the-table, so is Vietnam, okay nice cheap place to live but I understand, however the Philippines as well (really?) yes, I assume mafia/banking or something.",

Since we are working on a single monorepo, we encourage one another to cross language boundaries when it feels right. We believe that exposure to different environments makes you a better programmer.",

The same building blocks that power the marketplace enable other data collaboration use cases, like clean room data analysis and the automatic segmentation and delivery of data to other platforms. We're also building towards a future where users can leverage our collaboration tools without needing to push their data to us, instead our query engine will be embeddable where their data is already at rest.We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. While the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu\u00e9bec), and Poland.In brief, the technologies we use are:- Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Calcite in the backend. We love functional programming and make use of libraries like Cats, Cats-Effect, and FS2, but we keep a pragmatic stance on purity given our exposure to the Spark ecosystem.- Our services are deployed on AWS and provisioned using Terraform. We leverage the usual suspects: Fargate, EMR, RDS, Lambda, etc. and we're starting to lean into Kubernetes. Being a small team, we think twice before rolling out custom infrastructure that we'll need to monitor and maintain.- On the frontend, we use Typescript, VueJS, PrimeVue, Nuxt, and Vite.Job postings and more on information about our team and culture are available at:https://jobs.narrative.io/Apply by sending your resume to hiring-dev@narrative.io.",

We can only continue to add complexity for so much longer until the whole system collapses. \"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex.

                "Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer\nIn the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that\u2019s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.

With Covid I've come to realize I need to work in public more often.So an ideal fit would be a small/medium company with hair on fire problems that need solving that I can talk about publicly.What sort of problems do I like?A Taxi company in latam hired me to built a fleet maintenance system. It predicted and scheduled preventative maintenance to reduce wear and tear and avoid breakdowns. We also identified the leading cause of wear - leadfoot drivers. So we built a system that would identify aggressive driving.Another example was a speculative sports highlights annotation system I built with a consultancy. It ingested sports video and identified predetermined highlights in baseball - diving catches in our case. The ML pipeline was a CNN model which fed into an RNN. Given a bunch of video clips of diving catches as training data, it could later identify those diving catches and automatically annotate the video feeds.Who shouldn't contact me.If your market is Ads or gambling I'm not interested. Sure there's lot of money, but I'd rather sleep at night. Thanks.",

                "Y Combinator (yes, the people who run this site) | Infrastructure Software Engineer | Bay Area | Full-timeI currently run YC\u2019s infrastructure and I need some help! Over the last 7 years I\u2019ve been at YC, our software team has grown considerably both in engineers and in products. We need to invest more in our infrastructure so we can keep shipping our products quickly.The main thing you\u2019ll need in this job is curiosity; I work at every layer of a very large stack. One day you might dig into AWS apis, another it\u2019s a 3rd party Ruby gem or our git history. Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :)https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028511.The first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc).The main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you\u2019ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you\u2019ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform). You\u2019re probably the person people turn to when there\u2019s a fire to put out.YC has excellent compensation and benefits (see more in the formal job description:https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/y-combinator/jobs/0Ewh...). The team and the work life balance are great. About half of us are former founders and many of us are parents. And if you\u2019re curious about startups (and possibly starting one someday), this job gives you amazing access to interact with YC\u2019s programs, partners, and founders.If you\u2019re interested, I\u2019d love to chat!

The same building blocks that power the marketplace enable other data collaboration use cases, like clean room data analysis and the automatic segmentation and delivery of data to other platforms. We're also building towards a future where users can leverage our collaboration tools without needing to push their data to us, instead our query engine will be embeddable where their data is already at rest.We are a small, remote-first team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. While the company's headquarters are in NYC, the development team currently includes engineers working from the US (California and New York), Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, and Qu\u00e9bec), and Poland.In brief, the technologies we use are:- Scala, Spark, Apache Iceberg, and Apache Calcite in the backend. We love functional programming and make use of libraries like Cats, Cats-Effect, and FS2, but we keep a pragmatic stance on purity given our exposure to the Spark ecosystem.- Our services are deployed on AWS and provisioned using Terraform.

We're rethinking the entire property maintenance experience from the ground up with two things in mind - first, driving the cost of doing maintenance to the absolute minimum, and second, providing an experience to residents and property owners that makes them want to stay with their property manager. If you are excited about turning something that has historically been a negative experience (maintenance) into a positive experience, we'd love to talk with you.Stack: Python, Django, Typescript, React, PostgreSQL- Senior Software Engineer:https://property-meld.breezy.hr/p/80f57aad2cca-senior-softwa...If you are interested or have any questions email us at tech.jobs@propertymeld.com or apply via the above links.",

                "Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer\nIn the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that\u2019s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.

Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :)https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028511.The first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc).The main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you\u2019ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you\u2019ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform).

We\u2019ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.Healthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That\u2019s not why they got into care.What\u2019s worse, these systems aren\u2019t hugely successful\u2014clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies\u2019 pockets.We\u2019re changing that.At Juniper, we\u2019ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic\u2019s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)Our typical paid rate is above 95%.We are a team of 25 with STRONG product market fit\u2014we\u2019ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can\u2019t build quickly enough.You\u2019ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.Email me at chris@juniperplatform.com",

Our thesis is that scoring (a known/\"need to have\" part of the stack -- but able to be done 10x better with LLMs because you can incorporate the goldmine of unstructured engagement data) is the right wedge into building the intelligence-driven outbound sales stack of the future that _actually works_ for large companies that need to generate millions of dollars in pipeline each quarter.

                "Nuna (https://www.nuna.com) | San Francisco & Remote friendly (US only)| Full-time | Visa Transfer\nIn the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that\u2019s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.
