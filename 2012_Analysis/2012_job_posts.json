We\u2019re growing quickly and so far have managed to finance our own growth with our profits, but we\u2019re looking to fundraise soon.There are 2 people on the core team, and we coordinate a team of freelance writers who create all the content which we then sell to our customers. At the moment we\u2019re doing this all by hand, and we need a generalist-type full-stack engineer to give our company some much-needed tech muscle.The thing we need short-term is a web application which allows for content (text + links + images) to be input by our employees and passed through a workflow chain which ends at our customers. The thing we need long-term is a mechanism which allows our customers to be intelligently paired up with employees who would be a good fit for them- and also uses analytics from Facebook + Twitter + anything else to help us learn more about how to provide our customers with awesome, effective, engaging content. This is going to involve a lot of iteration and that\u2019s why we need a new core member of our team instead of an outsourced partner or contractor etc. This is a green-field proposition: you can work with whatever tech tools you like.

H1B okay.Sharing over social media is driving an ever-increasing percentage of web traffic, and becoming more central to the adoption and spread of every type of application. But app developers are flying blind -- not only are traditional web analytics very bad at tracking social traffic due to the rise of mobile clients and increasing prevalence of HTTPS, but even when they have the numbers, they don't have actionable data.That's the problem awe.sm solves: our platform tracks sharing behavior and results, and ties them back into meaningful metrics -- whether thats page views, signups, or a dollar value in sales. Our APIs and drop-in integrations allow developers to integrate social data deeply into their products without needing to reinvent the wheel (and our wheel is really shiny).We're an engineering-driven team building products primarily for other developers, so we're passionate about providing an amazing experience for developers. To help us get there, we're looking for a Developer Experience Lead, which you might also call a Platform Evangelist. By that we mean somebody who will own the experience a developer has using our product: somebody who understands deeply how to get the most out of awe.sm, and has the communication skills to get that information to developers. That will mean representing awe.sm at hackathons, conferences and other developer events, and being the primary point of contact for developers building on our platform on Stack Overflow and other forums. We want you to find the pain points before our customers do, and feed that information back to the engineering team, so we can adapt our product to real-world needs.This is an unusual role, combining technical talents with public speaking and writing skills, but for the right person it's a dream job, and there's no role more critical to our growth right now.http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernewsWe're 14 people right now.

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers\n* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)\n* iOS engineerThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/(The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. Remote work is fine.

                "Mapquest.comPrimarily in Denver, CO and Lancaster, PA, but we're a relatively distributed\ncompany so go ahead and ask if you live somewhere else. As an AOL subsidiary,\nwe've got employees who work out of AOL offices around the world so it wouldn't\nbe unheard of to work from e.g. Seattle or New York if you decide Denver's just got\ntoo much sunshine. I've also been told we will sponsor an H1B.Over the past year, MapQuest has brought on an almost entirely new management\nteam to shake things up and change the direction of the company from answering\nthe ? \"How do I get there?\" to answering the more interesting ? \"Where do I want to\ngo?\" We've released two new products in the last year (Discover and Local, formerly\nknown as Vibe) and are aggressively working on creating an engineering-driven\nculture that actually builds things people might want to use instead of polishing\nproducts that were cool in 2004. We've had a banner year, and are looking to hire\nengineers as well as product managers to continue this upward trend.Among the technical roles we're looking to fill are several Ruby developers at\nvarying levels of expertise to help develop new products as well as one Java\ndeveloper to work with our data team and revamp various backend services\n(i.e. search, geocoding and a data ingestion service that populates our location\ndatabases). Ever since Valve leaked their company handbook, the phrase \"T shaped\"\nhas been been thrown around a lot by upper management, so you'll need to be\nable to do full-stack development. We do a lot of pair programming right now, so if\nyou've got experience doing that, it'd be a big plus. We're particularly interested in\nsomeone who's got very deep Rails experience to serve as a sort of tech lead, but we\nhave many positions open for Rails people so if you'd be interested at all drop a line.Product is looking to bring on people with some combination of travel industry\nknowledge and mobile applications to help get the company past maps and\ndirections. Most of our product people have development experience, so you'll be\nexpected to be able to \"talk shop\" with the engineers you work with, but your day-\nto-day responsibilities aren't going to be producing code as much as producing\nideas, pitching them to the rest of the company and helping the engineers and\ndesigners see them through to completion.I can definitively say that MapQuest is among the best places I've ever worked. The\noffice space is fantastic (Downtown Denver right off the 16th Street Mall) and the\nnew management team is very serious about doing things right as we try to pivot\nthe company away from directions and into product development. The brand is\npractically a household name, the product team is happy to listen to engineers for\nfeedback or ideas, and we've got the interesting position right now of being able to\nwork like a startup except with a large pre-build audience (I've been told that we\nhad 40M UV's on a brand new product this past Thursday, for example). You can\nread the company postings here (http://company.mapquest.com/careers/) but I'd really enjoy being able to answer ?'s directly. My e-mail is in my profile and please\nfeel free to contact me personally if you have further ?'s, want to chat, or anything\nelse. Happy holidays, and hope to hear from some of you soon!",

                "Transcriptic: Core DeveloperMenlo Park, CATranscriptic is the \"Amazon Web Services\" for life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development. Experience reverse engineering USB based protocols is a plus.We're a very small startup (you'd be #5), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people. The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.max at transcriptic.comhttps://www.transcriptic.com/",

But with mobile clients and HTTPS, traditional web analytics isn't working anymore. We know we can do better, so awe.sm is building full-featured social media conversion tracking and analytics. We tell our customers the value of their social traffic in a metric that's meaningful to them, whether it's page views, signups or dollars of sales.

That will mean representing awe.sm at hackathons and other developer events, and being the primary point of contact for developers building on our platform. We want you to find the pain points before our customers do, and feed that information back to the engineering team, so we can adapt our product to real-world needs. We also want you to do anything else you can think of that will help: building demos, writing client libraries, expanding our documentation, or working one-on-one with clients who have novel problems, to see how we can expand the platform to meet their needs.We want you to eliminate friction from integrating awe.sm with our customers' systems.

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world\u2019s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world\u2019s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world\u2019s scientific literature to 2 billion people, magical things may happen.- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas (sending papers around the world with 12 month time-lags in every iteration) to a much faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.8 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)* iOS engineerThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://tcrn.ch/T42VWC(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://tcrn.ch/R6Pgrr(The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. Remote work is fine. We will handle re-location, including visas, if you would like to re-locate, but re-location is not necessary.If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu",

We have a collaboration room and a quiet room. It\u2019s simple. We respect you too much to describe the chairs or the equipment.Our CEO/founder is a marketer (see his blog: startup-marketing.com). He is the kind of marketer engineers like. If you are interested in marketing, you will learn a lot here. Writing code that is used by no one sucks. Things need to be marketed. Things need to be sold.Yes, of course the salary is competitive. Yes, of course you will get equity (we are a startup, after all). Yes, we have health and dental plans.Our current infrastructure includes Ruby, Rails and MySQL. Our Javascript is both homegrown and based on jQuery and Backbone.js frameworks.Our data set is growing. New technologies will be needed to support it. You will find and research them with us. It's a fun time.About YouYou are a startup-minded developer. You prefer a startup (somewhat chaotic) environment where you are given freedom and responsibility, as opposed to one where requirements are always clear, priorities don't change and processes are set.You are a generalist. In a small team it does not make sense to focus on one small area to the exclusion of everything else.You probably have a CS degree. If you don't, you have a pretty interesting story to tell.You are pretty senior. You can work without supervision. Number of years of experience does not matter.You do full stack web development. If you lean more towards back-end or front-end, it's fine, but you are still willing to tackle issues in all areas when needed.You probably don't call yourself a \"Ruby Developer\". You are simply a developer. Ruby is just a tool. If you need to learn a new one - pick up a book. We'll pay for it.You feel comfortable with databases. You know how to write code that does not kill them. In general, you always think about performance and how things will work under stress.If you find yourself doing a task more than a couple of times, you want to automate it.You enjoy teaching yourself whatever you need to get the job done. You are curious about new tools and technologies, but getting things done is always your first priority.You like talking to customers and help them with their problems. Support is not a chore - it's how we learn.You shepherd your features all the way into production. Until they have automated tests, are deployed, are monitored and integrated with analytics to see how they are affecting the business, they are not \"done done\".You like Facebook\u2019s \"Done is better than perfect\" and \"Move fast and break things\" posters, but don't take them to the absurd. When you see a piece of code, you can tell the difference between \"done\" and \"perfect\".You can (and like to) describe your solution, make your point and defend it.You voice your opinion when you disagree with something and don't care for passive aggressive behavior. We do argue here. Sometimes it might look not pretty from the outside, but it's because we really like and respect each other.SOUNDS INTERESTING? \nPlease apply here:https://qualaroo.com/join-us/full-stack-web-developer",

They love it, use it every day and whisper sweet nothings to it at night. The problem is that over time when dealing with a large number of users and lots of Excel files, Excel becomes unmanageable, inefficient and eventually 'Excel Hell' takes over.What invariably ends up happening is a big old-guard player comes in and convinces the company to get rid of Excel, getting them to use an Excel 'look and feel'. The problem is that it's not Excel - rather it's a crappy web grid that gives the company 10% of what Excel can do. This story has played out over and over again \u2013 the customer buys the solution, ends up hating it and eventually moves back to using Excel.At Vena we're coming at it from an entirely different angle: stay in Excel! We provide all the benefits of a big player solution while keeping the user in the one place they know and love: Excel.We're a well funded company in full entrepreneurial growth mode looking to hire the best. If you want to work on something that great companies like McDonalds and Wells Fargo actually use then look no further than Vena Solutions.",

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.We believe that science is dysfunctional, and we are working on fixing it. Almost every innovation in medicine and technology in the world has its roots in a science paper. If we want to speed up the world, we need to speed up science.There are many inefficiencies in science:* it's too slow (there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal and it being published)* all the world's research ends up behind extraordinarily expensive paywalls, even though it was authored and peer-reviewed for free by the scientific community* it hasn't moved out of PDF-land yet (scientists haven't been provided with the incentives to share things like data-sets, code, videos, and other kinds of rich media).We are working on fixing this. We dream of a world where research is shared instantly, as soon as it's finished; where scientists share their full scientific output (data-sets, code, videos, and comments on all this media), and not just papers; and where a villager in India has as much access to the world's scientific output as a professor at Harvard.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accomplish this mission. We have made a good start: 1.8 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 3,500 join each day. But there is much more to do.We're a 10 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is in Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)* iOS engineerThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://tcrn.ch/T42VWC(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://tcrn.ch/R6Pgrr(The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers.

Through great software and user experiences, we make programs run better, collect clean and consistent data and let our customers optimize their programs in real-time.We're hiring backend Python devs, front-end devs, PMs, etc. Here's our jobs page:http://www.energysavvy.com/jobs/We're also currently offering a $13,000 referral bonus to anyone who refers a dev/PM that we hire!

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.We believe that science is dysfunctional, and we are working on fixing it. Almost every innovation in medicine and technology in the world has its roots in a science paper. If we want to speed up the world, we need to speed up science. There are many inefficiencies in science:* it's too slow (there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal and it being published)* all the world's research ends up behind extraordinarily expensive paywalls, even though it was authored and peer-reviewed for free by the scientific community* it hasn't moved out of PDF-land yet (scientists haven't been provided with the incentives to share things like data-sets, code, videos, and other kinds of rich media).We are working on fixing this. We dream of a world where research is shared instantly, as soon as it's finished; where scientists share their full scientific output (data-sets, code, videos, and comments on all this media), and not just papers; and where a villager in India has as much access to the world's scientific output as a professor at Harvard.We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accomplish this mission. We have made a good start: 1.8 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 3,500 join each day. But there is much more to do.We're a 10 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is in Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:* full stack engineers* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)* iOS engineerThere is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission herehttp://tcrn.ch/T42VWC(The Future of Peer Review) and herehttp://tcrn.ch/R6Pgrr(The Future of Science)We want to hire world class engineers.

                "Mountain View, CA - Room 77 Hotel Search - Software Engineers (Full Stack), Mobile Developers (Android, iOS), Lead Designer, Marketing/Data Analyst, SEM/Email Analyst - H1B welcomeWhat we do and who we are looking for:It's simple - we want to build the world's best hotel search engine.  Best place to search (fastest, most relevant, most results), best place to research (data insight, recommendations), and the best place to shop (metasearch engine, finds lower prices from more sources worldwide).Travel is a big market and there hasn't been much innovation in the last ten years.  We were founded on the belief that consumers deserve to get transparency and a fair deal and we believe that tackling hotel search is a great way to help travelers make more informed decisions and save some moolah.  It's not the sexiest space to be in but the travel space is the 2nd largest commerce category and we think we can own a piece of the pie through a better product.Our engineering team is 15+ and growing and we're hungry for more talent because we've got big problems to solve. We look for people who work comfortably across the entire stack.  We run on Ubuntu, AWS and no specific language knowledge is necessary though we use a lot of C++, PHP, and Javascript.  We don't believe in micromanagement so you'll need to be someone who is self-motivated, not scared off by things you've never done, and willing to make mistakes and know when to ask for a helping hand.  Most of our engineering comes from Google, Facebook, Yandex and other top tier companies as well as top tier schools.On the marketing side, we need some firepower to get the word out there and build smart ways to analyze and optimize the paid traffic we're getting.  If you think it would be fun to compete in SEM against larger, more well-funded companies and you don't find it at all scary, we want to talk to you.  If you've done large scale email program build outs (things like automated price alerts, segmentation), we want to talk to you.What's it like working at Room 77?We're located a stone throws away from Red Rock Coffee in the heart of Downtown Mountain View.  We're a diverse bunch and we like to do a lot of team events.  Lunches are catered and we have a keg on tap, standard valley benefits apply including equity and competitive compensation.  You also get a travel stipend and a travel agent card to get massive savings when you take some R&R.Who believes in us?We've raised $13 million to date from VCs like General Catalyst, PAR, and Sutter Hill and companies like Concur (TripIt).  We're lucky to have both angels and advisers that have started companies like Expedia, MTV, HotelTonight, Nor1, and Zillow.  We're well connected to the industry so you don't have to worry about us having to bang on doors to get to the right folks, all we need to focus on is building a killer product that makes people fall in love with us.If you think this sounds interesting or you just want us to buy you a coffee when you're in Mountain View, reach out to us.

We collect GPS data from black boxes installed in cars, and from smartphone apps, and we analyse it to work out how well you are driving, so insurers can provide a fair price for insurance. This means that good drivers can get cheaper car insurance. We work with RoSPA in the UK for driver behavioural research into what constitutes good driving. We have customers and commercial pilots across Europe and South Africa with a range of global insurance companies, brokers and aggregators.Our processing engine is predominantly Ruby 1.9, with a Rails (3.2, rspec, cucumber etc) API frontend backed by Postgres. Redis and Resque power the processing queue, and we occasionally drop down to C++ for some number crunching (normally libs wrapped up in FFI Ruby bindings). We've got Cassandra for large scale querying and storage, and we manage all of this on AWS using Chef. We use Github, Campfire, Hubot, and Janky for code, collaboration and CI.Who are we looking for?We've potentially got a few vacancies over the next few months as more customers launch, but right now we're looking for a systems lead who can help keep our infrastructure running 24/7 as we grow, and also help our customers integrate with us. Ideally someone with experience of running large web services on AWS using Chef.If you'd like to know more, email me: gavin dot heavyside at mydrivesolutions dot com",

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.Academia.edu has over 1.5 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.We need talented engineers to help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that science is currently dysfunctional, and that there is a chance to make a big impact.We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventureshttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).We have a strong engineering culture. We're a 10 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring.The kinds of things you would be working on include:* building an API for Academia.edu, to allow developers to hook into our academic graph* building a great News Feed for all the research you want to follow* building a world class Analytics product giving scientists real-time metrics about the impact of their work* building infrastructure to make the site extremely fast and stableWhat we're looking for are:* Web development experience (building apps on your own is great)* Experience with the full engineering stack* Passion for engineering and building great productsAll the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue.

                "Shreveport, Louisiana - Full Time - Rails/iOS AgencyTwin Engine Labs - workwithus@twinenginelabs.comWe're an award winning, cutting edge design and engineering shop. We bootstrapped our company from two people (designer and engineer) to 11, and along the way learned a lot of lessons. A few of them are:1. Building tools that make our jobs easier in the future is smart and gives our agency an edge. You will be expected to constantly try to improve our process, and your voice will be heard.2. Following that point, if you think something should change? Do it. Let me know about it (CEO), get buy in from the other engineers, and don't wreck our timelines. But stop talking and start doing!3. Salespeople will never estimate your project officially. Ultimately, I will bring in a project, lay it in front of you, and ask the team to do a planning poker session. Your velocity is set at a scant 10 points, and the timeline is bid against that initial velocity. Under promise, over deliver.4. If you estimate poorly, you are expected to fix it. If the project just went off the rails due to things out of your control, then your feet won't be held to the fire, but if it's genuinely your fault, fix it. It's completely in your control.5. Try the impossible. We built The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, an impossible feat for it's day. We've built complex interfaces for Cisco, Symantec, and now are working with O'Reilly. Don't be afraid to use 2D Game frameworks if you have to. People don't contract Twin Engine Labs to do the status quo.6. Be a full stack engineer. Know iOS but not Rails? Talk to us. Know Rails but not iOS? Talk to us. You will be placed in projects of your capacity, but very quickly ramped up to both  platforms. We expect you to know everything from server deployments to iOS deployments, to Postgres optimization to Core Data optimization, from caching in Restful APIs to caching NSURL connections. Being a full stack engineer allows you to move faster than every other shop out there.7. Finally, work directly with the customer. You, as the engineer, will always be expected to speak with the customer faster than I can. I willalwaysgive you air cover when you need it (and I typically can see that coming from a mile away). As well, you'll hear their requirements from their mouths (no games of telephone here), and get to ask them questions, with the safety net that I always stand behind our employees.Perks? Multiple projects in a year, constantly learning the cutting edge techniques, and some seriously huge names under your belt.Our environment is flat. No Pointy Haired Bosses allowed or bean counters here. Paint yourself purple, turn yourself upside down, and spin around three times while you code. As long as you deliver, I don't care how you do it.Employees come into work at what is a reasonable hour to them. Our employees set their own start times, with flexible work at home situations when required. Most of them come into work because... well... we like each other :)Intrigued? Talk to us. We've helped multiple entrepreneurs sink funding, watched multiple apps receive awards, and are known in our region and nationally.",

Zipkin (https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/) is an example of the kinds of tools our team is building right now. The two central components are a dashboard/charting monitoring service as well as our own alerting system.Most of our infrastructure challenges stem from the sheer number of writes we need to deal with as well as the temporal nature of what we're doing - all of our writes need to happen within certain time periods and reads have to be consistent within certain time-frames to avoid engineers being woken up at 4am due to incorrect data from a dirty read. Given that we're the service which observes all the other critical components - our reliability requirements are also a huge challenge.The product challenge on this team is making sense of a whole lot of data. So there is a lot of cutting-edge data visualisation work. You have certain services running on thousands of nodes and teams want to use our product to quickly find outliers and scan their dashboards with key metrics. This means you have potentially thousands of timeseries with thousands of data points on the screen at the same time. This is a JavaScript gig where you get to think about algorithms and performance on a daily basis. We're also an internal tool, so we have the option of targeting cutting edge, modern browser features. In reality it means 90% of your time is working on cool stuff and not on getting IE to work.I think the biggest benefit of working on our product team is that you a level of autonomy which is hard to find on a user-facing product. So if you're the creative type who doesn't want to be micro-managed or told where to push those pixels, I think this is a really good gig.Right now we're looking for experienced engineers for both infrastructure and product. Our infrastructure is JVM-based and written in Scala, with some Python. Our product is written in JavaScript and we have some Ruby to deal with.

                "San Francisco Bay Area (South SF, CA); Counsyl is Hiring Engineers (H1B and others welcome to apply)Apply online:http://bit.ly/Counsyl_Engineering_HNAbout CounsylOver the last few years, we've grown from a dorm room startup to become one of the largest clinical genome centers in the world. Our pre-pregnancy genomic test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 1% of all births in the United States.As you might imagine, handling this kind of volume puts us in terra incognita. Our situation is similar to the one faced by Amazon in the 90s, before anyone knew how to scale an operation with such highly interconnected physical and informational components.To solve the problems associated with scaling the medical genome, we hire generalists rather than specialists. Our engineers are pragmatists who know when to use machine learning and when to use a simple regex, and understand in what sense those approaches are at different ends of a continuum. Many did not have a bioinformatics background before they joined, but all had strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms.Experience in general means little to us as genomics is a young field; working code means quite a lot more. If this sounds like your kind of company, we invite you to apply.About youYou should have a BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science (or equivalent) and significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by Github account, personal web page, or prior employment.You should also be a generalist, interested in rotating through the engineering team and working in one or more of these areas:- Genomics: design, validate, and optimize clinical genomic assays for rare Mendelian variants- Machine Learning and Data Science: extract meaning out of one of the largest clinical genomic datasets in the world- Robotics: automate and scale our backend to do more clinical sequencing and genotyping than anyone has ever done before- UI/UX: design the first widely adopted user interface for the medical genome- Clinical Integration: solve the wide variety of practical issues associated with translating genomics into a clinical context- Infrastructure: build and deploy the hardware and software systems that support secure, large-scale computations on genomic datasetsFrom a skills perspective, you should have familiarity with several of the following technologies. We obviously don\u2019t expect you to know everything on the list, but you should be nodding to yourself by the end of it.- Python: Django, Numpy, Scipy, Cython- HTML/CSS/JS: Coffeescript, Backbone.js, Twitter Bootstrap 2, HTML5 APIs, Chrome Web Inspector- C++: STL, gcc/g++, Boost, C++11- Functional Programming: Haskell, underscore.js, functional reactive programming- Data Science and Visualization: GNU GSL, CUDA, Netlib/LAPACK, graphviz, R, Matlab, Matplotlib, Numerical Recipes- DevOps/System Administration: Amazon Web Services, Puppet, nginx, nagios, Apache, Fabric- APIs: REST, JSON, SOA, and all that jazz- Biological Databases: NCBI, UCSC, 1000 Genomes, Hapmap, UK10K- Sequencing/Computational Biology: OLB, samtools/pysam, pygr, galaxy/bxpython, kent utilities- Unix/Linux: bash/zsh, emacs/vim, git, GNU toolchain- PostgreSQL: psycopg2, hstore, replication- Security: skipfish, SSL, fuzz testing, preventing XSS & SQL injectionsAgain, please consider these guidelines, not absolutes. For example, if you know Chef, we figure you can learn Puppet, and if you know Ruby, we figure you can learn Python.In general, you should enjoy taking care of the practical last mile problems needed to actually achieve a societal ROI on the world's multibillion dollar investment in the Human Genome Project.What you'll do:- Move fast without breaking things :)\n- Start in the areas you're familiar with, and grow to work on the full stack\n- Work closely with a small, tight-knit team\n- Develop algorithms and code for all aspects of clinical genomics, from machine learning to supply chain optimization to insurance billing\n- Quite literally save lives with your keyboardWhat you'll get:- Competitive compensation and start-up equity package\n- Excellent health insurance\n- Catered meals every day plus a fully stocked fridge\n- Gym access to work it off\n- MacBook Pro, 30\" monitor, iPad, iPhone, and all the gadgets you needApply online:http://bit.ly/Counsyl_Engineering_HN",

                "San Francisco, CA. Full time.Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.Almost every technological and medical innovation in the world has its roots in a scientific paper. Science drives much of the world\u2019s innovation. The faster science moves, the faster the world moves.It's widely held that science is too slow, and too closed. We are working on changing that, and re-inventing the way that scientists communicate. The stakes are high. If the inefficiencies in science can be removed, we may be able to accelerate science by a factor of 2, leading to a huge impact for humanity.For more on the problem Academia.edu is solving, see the guest post on TechCrunch last Sunday on 'The Future of Science' by Academia.edu's founder, Richard Pricehttp://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/Academia.edu has over 1.3 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.We recently raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventureshttp://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).We need talented engineers to come and help us with the mission. We have a strong engineering culture. We're an 11 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is in Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, athttp://academia.edu/hiring.The kinds of things you would be working on include:\u2605 tools for scientists to share their work faster and more openly\u2605 algorithms to mine our data, and to find out what research is trending in real time\u2605 back-end infrastructure to scale the site on AWSWhat we're looking for are:\u2600 2+ years of web development experience\u2600 Experience with the full engineering stack\u2600 Passion for engineeringAll the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them.

                "Berlin (Germany), CTO/ lead developerWe are a funded (seed) startup working on a customer analytics tool for online retailers.We are two people looking for a head of development / CTO. We have offices in Berlin, funding for one year and the package includes very generous shares for the right candidate. We use lean startup methods, and can systematically test hypotheses on any market. Hundreds of customer interviews already done. Our approach is the \u2018startup of startups\u2019, that is, iterate fast and discard what doesn\u2019t work, even if the new product looks like a completely new application (and startup!).What we do:-----------Customer Lifefitime Value (CLV) is the mythical \u2018magic number\u2019, the amount of money a particular customer will ever bring in. Knowing your CLV makes it trivial to:\n- optimize marketing spend for different inbound channels.\n- identify your highest value customers, \n- identify those in danger of never coming back.Most shops have a \u2018gut feeling\u2019 of what their CLV is, but no way of knowing for sure. Yet this is the number that would make the largest impact to their bottom line, if only it was possible to have it. Ah! Predicting the future is hard, right?It turns out CLV can be computed with surprising accuracy (10% error) at the individual level. At Fluidshopping, we use sophisticated bayesian models to estimate CLV. We look beyond what has happened in the past (which you get with say google analytics). CLV changes often, due to your marketing actions, season, or changes in the market. We retrain our models weekly to reflect those changes, and then suggest the actions that would make the largest impact (email campaigns, popups with offers triggered by user behavior on your site, etc).Requirements:-------------You can apply with any language. But we need code samples. Let us see something you build; please explain what it does and how to run it if it\u2019s not obvious. We prefer github projects. Do not send code samples that do not make sense out of context. We are looking for a difficult problem you solved, or a common problem that you solved in a novel way.You need to be within 5 years of your last academic appointment, or graduation. That is, if you graduated from university more than 5 years ago, you are not eligible. You can also apply if you had a job in research settings within the last 5 years. We do not care about you having a title, but we are funded by the government, and they do. They want to see someone with a compSci-related title. We are really sorry in advance if the requirement excludes you, a great hacker who doesn\u2019t have a title.Responsibilities:-----------------Your responsibilities will be to work on new key features, help us scale, contribute to the product and optimize performance. You\u2019ll be the CTO in an agile development environment. Customer interviews tell us our solution attacks a very obvious pain point for online retailers, a large market that is ripe for disruption. As a CTO, you will make decisions to make sure our solution \u2018just works\u2019 for clients. We have excellent talent for both front-end and back-end development, so you are free to concentrate on the problems that matter most (architecture, models, etc). But of course, in a small team you will need to write production-quality code yourself.Nice to have:------------Mongo or similar NoSQL db\nJavaScript, Backbone.js, node if you have used it in production\npython/django, ruby/rails or any other web framework\nFamiliarity with HTML5 (websockets)\nR or any other data-friendly language with lots of libraries\nFamiliarity with probability theory and modelingPerks:------Work from home (optional)\nStock options in two-digit range\nDog\nTerrace with barbecue\nIn the center of the Berlin startup ecosystem\nContinuous deployment, strong testing culturecontact: jobs@fluidshopping.com",

We're looking to expand our team.A UI Engineer will work with our design and development teams in building applications across a variety of platforms. They\u2019re apprentice craftsmen who take the vision from our design team and turns it into a reality for our clients.This is a junior or entry level UI engineer  (Freelancer? Drop us a line too...)Here\u2019s what\u2019s cool about working for us.1.  You\u2019ll have fun.  We\u2019re fun and we work with fun clients like NBC, CBS, the UFC.  We might have some late nights but we\u2019ll keep it interesting.2. You\u2019ll become a better software engineer.   There\u2019s really no choice, from project to project you might be working in Javascript and HTML to pure Javascript, you might need to hack together a php script and then update some Objective-C. We don\u2019t expect you to know how to do all this when you start, but you\u2019ll learn.  That\u2019s how we\u2019ve done it.3. You\u2019ll ship.  Again small shop, fast projects that ship. You will  be able to show your friends an app on TV or your mobile device and say, \u201cI built that\u201d.4.

We work on the cutting edge and we aren\u2019t tied to large legacy systems. This gives us the ability to use whatever tools we like. We use Redis, Nodejs, Websockets etc.  In particular we do a lot of work on embedded platforms using WebViews (and will likely do more as Moore\u2019s law keeps going on mobile devices) so HTML5 skills are greatHere\u2019s a few things that we can\u2019t provide.1. An Exit. We\u2019re not a startup, we\u2019re an agency so there\u2019s no big exit. That being said we do do bonuses at the end of the year based on how well we\u2019ve done.2. Stable work on a single project working on a single language or framework.    Again not what we do, we tend to do short 2-6 month engagements on projects for our clients we design an app, build it and then ship it.  We do it right and we do it fast.3. A lot of management overhead.  We\u2019re small (tiny really - you\u2019d be one of our first hires) so we can\u2019t watch over you all the time. Best if you\u2019re somewhat self-sufficient.Nice to have?Here\u2019s some skills that will help you get this job (a few of these would be nice).1. \tHTML - in particular its good to know new HTML5 display elements.2. \tCSS(3)3. \tJavascript - this is our primary language.

                "San Francisco, CAPagerDuty -http://www.pagerduty.comFULLTIME* Front-end Developer (http://www.pagerduty.com/jobs/engineering/frontend-engineer)* DesignerWhat we do:At PagerDuty, we're building an alerting and incident tracking system that helps IT operations groups detect and respond to high-severity issues.We're not like the thousands of monitoring systems out on the market. In fact, we don't do monitoring at all. Instead, we plug into existing monitoring systems and handle the people part of the equation: alerting (via phone, SMS, email), on-call scheduling for teams, auto-escalation of critical alerts, and incident tracking.Our current product helps IT ops people know about critical problems as quickly as possible, collaborate as a team to fix problems quickly, and help track and improve incident response performance over time. Our vision is to expand into the event management space. This means treating data from monitoring tools as events and intelligently filtering and correlating events across monitoring tools in order to reduce the noise. It's like spam filtering for events: a critical problem, such as a bad deploy, will automatically alert the entire team via phone call, while a minor issue like a server going down in a fleet of 20 will only generate a low-priority email alert.Why you should work with us:We are different than many startups out there: we charge money for a product. Companies like Intuit, National Instruments, VMWare, Square and 37signals love our product; that's a lot to say for a system that frequently wakes our users up in the middle of the night. We're also fairly early stage (13 people plus a few interns). This combination means you'll get a market-rate salary plus a decent chunk of stock in a company that has already figured out product/market fit.We put a very big focus on the user experience (UI/UX), since some of our core concepts can initially be confusing to people who don't have a lot of experience in the operations and support realm. We want to guide people to use best practices whenever possible. Our customers span a gamut of sizes, from small start-ups just trying to monitor their websites to enterprise clients like Heroku who have to monitor thousands of servers and deal with complex infrastructural issues. As a result, our UIs have to scale and be intuitive with a wide range of data. Simply put, we're solving problems no one else has solved before, and we're doing so by designing clean, elegant, easy-to-use UIs.To apply, please send your resume to jobs@pagerduty.com.",

We have a success-story video on our site from Supervalu, a large retail store chain in the US, and their CTO tells a story about how Yammerliterallychanged the way they do business. In the old world, store managers would report their intelligence up the managerial chain, the upper management would try to synthesize everything, and 3 months later a \"report\" would be issued that told everyone how to best try to do their jobs. After Yammer, store managers would just talk to each other over Yammer, learn directly what was successful and what wasn't, and as a side effect, let the upper management gain invaluable visibility into day-to-day operations. When we say Yammer \"breaks down silos\" and \"enables horizontal communication\", this is what we mean. Sure, Yammer is just like Facebook, but we're so much more than that. Corporations don't share cat pictures, they turn into efficient business machines.Supervalu testimonial video:https://www.yammer.com/customersIn fact, Supervalu isn't the only company that has changed the way they work due to Yammer.

If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from- every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer- actively upgrading our version of Rails, and not stopping until we hit bleeding edge. We hit Rails 2.3.14 last week and hope to hit 3.0.11 within the month- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselvesCauses is a great place to better yourself and better the world.

Like writing exploits?  Enjoy challenges like \"Here's a file that crashes -application- , figure out why\"?  Want to work with us to design what is next in Snort?  ClamAV?  Razorback?  Or any of the above topics?We want you.Let me talk about what I like.The smartest people I've ever met all in one room.  We get to bounce ideas off of each other, figure out strange ways of fixing a problem, and come up with a solution.  That means anything from controlling EIP to how to write a rule to compare two things from two different streams using flowbits.We pride ourselves in doing things not only better than the competition, but in the open too.We work hard.  We play hard.  For instance, today, during break, we played kickball (remember that?) with a big yoga ball, and the ball got stuck in a tree.  Yours truly climbed said tree and retrieved the ball.  Then I came back inside and pulled apart some malware.  Beware of nerf darts, RFI readers, and the 6lb sand-filled ball of doom.Like working in an environment where it doesn't matter how you wind up at the result, as long as you get the correct results?  Tired of being told what OS to use?  Like debating the merits of C, perl, or ruby?  Have a strong opinion between bash and zch?If there's a problem that we don't have a solution for, we invent one.  Last thing we invented resulted in patents that have our people's name on them.Working on next years projects this year.Being the best.When you write protection for a vulnerability or malware here, you cover IDS/IPS, a NGFW, and two antivirus systems.  You protect networks from endpoint to border and into the cloud.If you gag when you hear the word cloud or synergy.Vegetarian?  Paleo? Meat eater?  There is someone here that will sympathize with you.Working for the fastest growing company in security\nHonestly there's way too many things to list.Our currently open job listings are here.https://sourcefire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseacti...But that's not even the complete list.

                "Seattle, San Francisco, Cupertino (and other places), FULL-TIME, INTERN, H1BA lot of people think Splunk must be a terrible place to work at because they think it is an \"enterprise\" company. But the truth is, we have great jobs for a lot of people. Want to work on awesome visualizations for gigabytes and terabytes of data daily? We got it. Want to work on building a development platform for an extremely powerful data analysis tool? We got it. Want to help make the core server that powers our extremely fast indexing and performance better? We got it.For example, my project for the past couple of months has been to develop our new Node.js/Browser SDK, including pulling some of our propietary UI components and sharing them with the world. We also do a lot of work with customers to best help them use Splunk. One of the projects I was involved in included analyzing social data using Splunk (like Twitter/Foursquare).Whether it's UI, core systems engineering, dev platform or anything in between, we likely have something for you. I personally work on the development platform in the Seattle office, but I'm happy to answer questions about anything. Feel free to shoot me an email (in my profile), or comment here.I wanted to highlight a few specific positions we're looking for:* Dev. Platform Software Engineer: This is the team I work on. We strongly believe that there is a use for Splunk outside of logging, and we're enabling the usage of the technology for dealing with large quantities of data, whether it's for social network analysis, cloud management or anything in between.http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oHkCVfwi* Cloud Software Engineer: we're developing the next stage of our product, which is a hosted version of Splunk in the cloud, with all the benefits you'd expect (like automatic elastic scaling). Come help us make this a reality:http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o4U8VfwL* Hadoop Software Engineer: Usage of Hadoop is exploding to do batch-oriented processing on massive quantities of data. We think there is a lot of value to be had by combining the power of Splunk and Hadoop, and we're developing solutions to make this possible.http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oqCaWfwS* Software Engineer in Test: Splunk is a complex machine, deployed in a distributed manner, many times being used for different things. Our testing team is top notch, and helps us deliver quality releases.http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o5ZvVfwe* Windows QA Engineer: Splunk is putting a lot of effort into making Splunk & Windows to be a match made in heaven. We need people to help us make sure we're getting everything quite, because details matter.http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=oLpdWfw3* Server Sustaining Engineer: Splunk is a very customer-focused company, and it's important that customers are happy with the products. The sustaining team is in charge of making sure that after major releases, we can keep customers happy for a long time.http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=obAdWfwE",
                "San Francisco, CAPagerDuty -http://www.pagerduty.comFULLTIME, INTERN* Software Engineers (http://www.pagerduty.com/jobs/engineering/software-engineer)* Front-end Engineers (http://www.pagerduty.com/jobs/engineering/frontend-engineer)* Operations / Devops Engineers* Software Engineering InternWhat we do:At PagerDuty, we're building an alerting and incident tracking system that helps IT operations groups detect and respond to high-severity issues.You know how there are thousands of monitoring systems out there? We don't do monitoring. Instead, we plug into all of the existing monitoring systems and handle the people part of the equation: alerting (via phone, SMS, email), on-call scheduling for teams, auto-escalation of critical alerts, and incident tracking.Our current product helps IT ops people know about critical problems as quickly as possible, collaborate as a team to fix problems quickly, and help track and improve incident response performance over time. Our vision is to expand into the event management space. This means treating data from monitoring tools as events and intelligently filtering and correlating events across monitoring tools in order to reduce the noise. It's like spam filtering for events: a critical problem, such as a bad deploy, will automatically alert the entire team via phone call, while a minor issue like a server going down in a fleet of 20 will only generate a low-priority email alert.Why you should work with us:We are different than many startups out there: we charge money for a product. Companies love our product; that's a lot to say for a system that frequently wakes our users up in the middle of the night. Our revenue is growing steadily at more than 10% month-over-month since we launched in Jan 2010. Our customers include: Netflix, National Instruments, VMWare, NBC Universal, Square, Heroku, and 37signals. We're also fairly early stage (11 people, pre-series A). This combination means you'll get a market-rate salary plus a decent chunk of stock in a company that has already figured out its business model.We have very interesting technical challenges. Our biggest challenge is engineering a system that never ever goes down. Since our customers rely on us to deliver their critical alerts, we are not allowed to go down ever. This means we've had to engineer a distributed system across multiple data centers that can survive a single data-center outage without skipping a beat. We're not done: we have a lot more work to do to ensure our system reaches the level of telephony reliability (five-nines). If you like engineering distributed fault-tolerant systems, join us.To apply, please send your resume to jobs@pagerduty.com.",

Want to work on building a development platform for an extremely powerful data analysis tool? We got it. Want to help make the core server that powers our extremely fast indexing and performance better? We got it.For example, my project for the past couple of months has been to develop our new Node.js/Browser SDK, including pulling some of our propietary UI components and sharing them with the world. We also do a lot of work with customers to best help them use Splunk. One of the projects I was involved in included analyzing social data using Splunk (like Twitter/Foursquare).Whether it's UI, core systems engineering, dev platform or anything in between, we likely have something for you. I personally work on the development platform in the Seattle office, but I'm happy to answer questions about anything. Feel free to shoot me an email (in my profile), or comment here.I wanted to highlight a few specific positions we're looking for:* Dev. Platform Software Engineer: This is the team I work on.

Help us make the UI/UX as easy and intuitive to use as possible:http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=okQ4VfwT* Cloud Software Engineer: we're developing the next stage of our product, which is a hosted version of Splunk in the cloud, with all the benefits you'd expect (like automatic elastic scaling). Come help us make this a reality:http://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAGK3?jvi=o4U8VfwL* Hadoop Software Engineer: Usage of Hadoop is exploding to do batch-oriented processing on massive quantities of data.

Keep reading.THE MISSIONSwipely revolutionizes how local merchants do business, arming them with innovative technology that puts the clunky, archaic systems used by big retailers to shame. We're the Robin Hood of business, disrupting the payment space to enable the little guys to do what only the big guys can, and then some. We interact directly with both merchants and their customers, impacting the personal experience on both sides in deep, meaningful ways. We turn rewards and loyalty upside-down (or, as we see it, rightside-up!) by giving points and discounts to customers through their credit card, without the need for special cards, mobile apps, bar codes, or anything else that gets in the way of the experience. We analyze every payment transaction, providing intuitive reports and automated tools for merchants that use them to grow and deeply engage their customers. And that's just the beginning of the possibilities with our passionate team, unique resources, and mission to make our merchants successful!THE OPPORTUNITYCombine a world-class front-end team with a powerfully creative atmosphere, and you get a compelling culture that liberates us all to envision and realize innovative product ideas every day. You will push your own limits of what you think is possible with a user experience. You will propose and refine new concepts, comps, technologies, and solutions, and get the support needed across the company to realize the untapped potential we have yet to discover.  You will work with top sales, marketing, and product talent that deeply values innovation and the engineers that drive it.Evolution is our greatest ally. We built the first incarnation of Swipely with jQuery, experimented with Backbone yet quickly realized we needed more structure, and now cruise on YUI3, with YUI3.5 around the corner. We rock MVC-driven, single-page applications, fully templatized Handlebars views, restful JSON persistence to our Rails backends, frontend unit and integration tests, and (soon!) a pushState architecture with hot data visualizations.We always track and contribute to new technologies like D3, Node.js, Ember, Harmony, CoffeeScript, and Less. Exploration and collaboration are part of our culture, and any topic that can improve our engineering efforts is fair game, including NoSQL storage, Nginx/Unicorn architecture, and deployment and continuous integration tools.THE REQUIREMENTSYou love what you do. You wake up every day more passionate about the web\u2019s IxD models and UX than the day before. You demand the highest quality of your projects and want to work with people who demand and inspire the same, from the code down to the pixels. You get energized when opening new Fireworks and Photoshop comps and diving deep with designers.You are self-directed and take initiative with confidence, yet know when to include others. You communicate effectively and thoughtfully. You appreciate the value of documentation. You are accountable for the entire user experience, from conception to production.You love contributing to opensource. Your Github profile is a hive of exciting collaborations. You strive to learn and shape emerging projects. You lead and inspire others with your own applications and sites in your free time. You go out for drinks with your friends and have engrossing discussions about the web. You love freenode.Your JavaScript knowledge is one of your greatest assets. You instinctively understand where native JavaScript ends and frameworks begin. Your extensive experience with MVC and design patterns guides you to insightful and intuitive solutions. You are eager to define new TDD and BDD frontend flows. You\u2019re gratified that your language of choice is currently the most popular on Github and is evolving in leaps and bounds on the server-side. You love your backend developer. You regard as common knowledge that robust, performant code is integral to a compelling UX.Your HTML5 and CSS3 expertise expands as fast as the specs are updated. You shiver with anticipation for Level 4 CSS selector support, consistent gradient rule syntax, and native grid layouts. You rock the Chrome Dev channel and wish the Safari updates were out already. You crave responsive design. You know when to go web versus native.THE BENEFITSSwipely is small yet growing rapidly with explosive signup rates (seriously, off the charts!) offering Silicon Valley style startup perks and more.

Consumer software is easy to explain, you can share it immediately with your friends, and you get to apply both technical and design skills. Business-to-business software is well and good, but there's a reason why we aren't writing automated trading platforms for hedge funds :) SCRUFF has been fortunate to find a market that is both growing quickly and very excited about our product. When you come on board, the code you write will affect hundreds of thousands of guys every day.\u2022 Our #1 priority for you is your professional developmentMost startups want engineers to start producing shipping code on day one. We would much rather take the time to allow you to explore our codebase, do deep dives into the technologies we use, and ultimately write great production code in weeks or months. We feel mentorship is one of the most critical aspects of enjoying your job.We also strive to practice good core software engineering principles, because we believe in the long-run it will make the code you write better, bring more benefits to our members, and be most helpful for you in your career. The ideal candidate should come in with a healthy ego and a positive attitude, be open to critical feedback, and be eager to develop more in the practice of professional software development.\u2022 You will touch every piece of code we have.Our engineering team is small. There are no client-side/server-side functional divides. You will be responsible for the servers (we have a lot). You will be responsible for the client (iOS and Android). Your brain will be stretched in new and confounding ways. But in the process you will build a set of skills that will form the core of all software innovation of the next 10 years. What we teach you at SCRUFF about mobile development will be like learning HTML in 1995 or GUI programming in 1985.\u2022 Parties are our business, and now they're yours, too.No, seriously. Lots of startups will talk about their Friday night beer busts, but at SCRUFF we take it to a new level. SCRUFF partners with promoters and events all across the world. As a SCRUFF team member, you will become part of the SCRUFF brand, and will have opportunities to represent us at events both locally and across the country.\u2022 New York City.SCRUFF is based in Manhattan, the most amazing city in the world. Everyone you've ever met will want to come and visit. Your other friends who work at banks will complain to you about their schedules while you are busy planning SCRUFF parties into your workday(night?) Startup networking events will be blocks away, every day. You'll have access to the most restaurants, the most culture, and an endless stream of new people to meet.
